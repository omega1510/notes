# Early Industrial Society

## Pro [[Capitalism]] Laws
Great Britain’s and the Netherlands’ [[Gentry]] government removed limitations on manufacturing, such as guilds and tariffs. People moved freely, working or investing in whatever they were passionate about. Additionally, governments began to provide monetary incentives (Nobel Prize), as well as patents to protect inventor rights.

One of the best examples of this approach was when they repealed the Corn Laws (a tariff on grains). A potato fungus from the Americas came to Europe in the 1849s, devastating the key crop in Northern and Western Europe. This caused massive famines, especially in Ireland, resulting in mass death and emigration to the United States. The British parliament removed the Corn Laws to allow for better trade and cheaper grain in times of famine.

## Creation of New Classes
The [[Industrial Revolution]] caused the formation of two new classes: the middle and working class.

### Middle Class
The middle class enjoyed a much improved lifestyle as factory owners, bankers, doctors, teachers, and other jobs. They are different from the middle class today; the middle class in the early industrial society was much, much richer than they are now. They, combined with the upper class, greatly benefited from the creation of [[Railroads]], although the working class fared worse.

### Working Class
The working class during this period were mostly former peasants forced into poor, run-down housing. They worked 10-14 hours a day, 6 days a week, with poor pay. Child labor was prevalent in factories, with little legal action taken against it.

Working conditions were very dangerous, with little protection if a worker was injured or sick. Any attempts to unionize were met with resistance from the middle class and the government, both of which wanted a cheap and free economy.

## [[Socialism]]
Socialism was formed to protect the exploited working class amid the clear divide between them and the middle class.
