# Gentry
---

After the onset of [[Mercantilism]] and [[Commercialization]], economies completely changed. A new class of people were created in England and the Netherlands: the gentry. They were a group of self-made people who became rich or powerful through trade. At the beginning, they had no political power because most governments were run by hereditary nobles and kings. However, over the course of the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, the gentry would acquire their rights through violence and bloodshed, most notably the [[English Civil War]].

When King Charles I #person of England went to war with Scotland, he quickly used up all of England’s capital, along with his own personal funds. Although he tried not to, he was forced to call upon the elite gentry for support. The gentry were called in to form a body called the House of Commons. Immediately, they passed a law making the House of Commons a permanent entity in Parliament. ^39c040

In the Netherlands, a country without a monarchy, merchants and bankers quickly gained political power and the Netherlands was set up as an oligarchy.

> Oligarchy is a form of power structure in which power rests with a small number of people. These people may or may not be distinguished by one or several characteristics, such as nobility, fame, wealth, education, or corporate, religious, political, or military control.
