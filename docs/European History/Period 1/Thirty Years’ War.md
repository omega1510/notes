## Start of the War
The Thirty Years’ war started as a war between Protestants and Catholics, but ended with nearly every European nation involved. It began in 1618 when [[Centralization of Power#Spain and France|King Ferdinand]] tried to impose religious uniformity in the Holy Roman Empire, a direct violation of the [[Charles V#Peace of Augsburg war|Peace of Augsburg]].

Although many noble princes united against King Ferdinand, Habsburg regions (Spain, Austria, and Italy) pushed them to the brink of defeat. However, Sweden prolonged the conflict to expand their territorial holding in Northern Europe at the expense of the Holy Roman Empire. Gustavus Adolphus #person, Sweden’s brilliant military mastermind, used the combined force of several armies in the region – a practice the Catholic army immediately copied.

## Religious War?
The war originally began as an internal conflict between Germans in the Holy Roman Empire, but as the entire Habsburg Monarchy and Sweden joined in, it became the most destructive war until World War I. Aid for the [[Protestant Reformation|Protestant]] princes grew as England, the Netherlands, and Russia all sent in troops and supplies.

Following the death of Adolphus, France (a Catholic country) actually helped the Protestant forces. France wanted to defeat the Habsburg Monarchy to gain political power and land. This became a running theme in religious wars, as powerful states (mainly Spain and France) began to exploit them for political gain.

## Peace of Westphalia (1648)
With Sweden and France on the Protestant side, the Catholics had to surrender when Spain went bankrupt. In 1648, ambassadors from all participating nations were sent to Westphalia, Germany, to negotiate the surrender of the Catholic side.

Sweden and France gained the most land from the treaty. The Netherlands were also granted independence from Spain. Additionally, German princes of the Holy Roman Empire could choose and Christian sect and were free from Catholic control.

## Impacts of the War
1. Conflicts now focused on a new concept: the [[Balance of Power]]. From 1648 onwards, nations joined conflicts in order to prevent one state from becoming too strong in Europe, as Spain had been during the [[Early Modern Society|Early Modern Era]] (silver mining and [[Age of Exploration#Spain and Portugal|exploration]].
2. Peace talks involved all members of the conflict, instead of the major ones.
3. [[Centralization of Power|Centralized states]] with national armies and taxes were proven to be more effective.
4. Spain and the Holy Roman Empire focused their efforts on the Ottoman Empire in Eastern Europe
5. Over 1/3 of all German people died in the conflict.
