## Puritans
Like the Huguenots in France and the [[Protestant Reformation#Calvinism Zwinglianism|Calvinists]] in the Netherlands, a group in England called the Puritans also used religious conflict to change their religious laws.

The Puritans were radical [[Protestant Reformation|Protestants]] that felt that the [[Church of England|Anglicans]] were too similar to the Catholics. They believed that Anglicans should lean toward Protestant Christianity instead.

Puritans were persecuted by the State for their heretic views. To escape the persecution, many Puritans left England for America or the Netherlands.

## Religious Pluralism
While many states attempted to control religion, many groups like the Puritans, [[Protestant Reformation#Calvinism Zwinglianism|Calvinists]], and [[Protestant Reformation#Opposition to Protestantism|Anabaptists]] resisted. To avoid resistance, some areas took a different approach. Once the Spanish were defeated by the Netherlands in the [[Charles V#Dutch Revolts Eighty Yearsâ€™ War war|Dutch Revolts]], the new Dutch government voted for religious pluralism. Rather than worry about Calvinism or Catholicism, the Dutch simply wanted to maintain peace and unity.

Earlier in France, Henry of Navarre #person had already allowed religious pluralism in the kingdom through the *Edict of Nantes*.
