## Start of the Protestant Reformation
[[Martin Luther]] #person nailed his book, 95 Theses, to a church door in Wittenberg, Germany. In it, he outlined the several problems he had with Catholic Christianity. In doing so, he started a new branch of Christianity: Protestantism.

## Lutheranism
Luther believed that people should interpret the bible for themselves and not depend on the Church for their religion. He strongly advocated that Christianity should be taught solely from Scripture (New Testament, Old Testament, Psalms, etc.) and the interpretation left to the individual.

Without a powerful figure like the Pope to center his branch around, Luther resorted to using the printing press and other leaders to spread his message. He coupled his writings with Bibles printed in local languages, allowing them to spread like wildfire. While only some people were literate, people often gathered in towns to have Luther’s message read to them.

The ease of access that the printing press provided to Luther’s works was vital in ensuring the Protestant Reformation’s swift growth. Furthermore, this contributed to the development of common vernacular language and grammar, helping develop nationalism and a sense of community in the modern era. ^e5a436

Most nobles did not agree with Luther’s ideas but instead embraced Protestantism with the hope that they could take the Church’s land and riches. The Roman Catholic Church had started losing noble followers because of this affluent thought process and their money-generating practices. The Protestant branch of Christianity fit like a glove: they could break free from the Pope’s power and make their own religious laws by interpreting the Bible how they wanted to understand it. No longer was the nobles’ wealth bound by religious guidelines they disagreed with.

## Calvinism (Zwinglianism)
While [[Martin Luther]]‘s ideas developed into Lutheranism in German and Scandinavian areas, Scotland, Switzerland, France and the Netherlands followed another branch. Started by John Calvin #person and Ulrich Zwingli #person, Calvinists were very similar to Lutherans: they were against Church traditions and supported salvation through faith alone.

However, they disagreed on two primary things: predestination and communion. Calvinists believed that everyone is predestined to go to heaven or hell, and can do nothing to change that fate. For communion, Calvinists believe the bread represents Jesus’s body, while Lutherans believe it is literal.

## Opposition to Protestantism
Luther expected everyone to agree with him once they read and interpreted the Bible for themselves, but it soon became clear that others would disagree with his interpretations.

Anabaptists began interpreting the Bible for themselves, just as Luther had taught, but began attacking the practice of infant baptism. They believed that an adult must choose to be baptized. When Catholic and Protestant rulers attempted to control their beliefs, Anabaptists reacted violently. They were considered radical and were killed, tortured, imprisoned, and chased out of towns.

## German Peasant Revolts
The German Peasant Revolts started after the peasants read the bible. Under the feudal system, peasants were taxed, overworked, and their rulers lived luxurious lives. To the peasants, Christians should be a harmonious Christian society, whose rulers rule kindly, don’t overtax, and provide aid. 

In 1524, hundreds of towns rose up against their lords and rulers, killing everyone on a rampage for 2 years. While the issues themselves were not religious, it was Luther’s ideas of Christianity and his interpretation of the Bible that were the direct cause of the revolt. Other revolts would soon follow as nobles increased taxes on their peasants.
