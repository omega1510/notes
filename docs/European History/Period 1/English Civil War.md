# English Civil War
---

Through the English Civil War, the [[Gentry]] in England gained much more political power in Great Britain. Prior to this, the monarch shared power with Parliament.

## Parliament Before the War

Although Parliament played an important role in raising funds and making laws, they could still be called and dismissed by the King. When Parliament and King Charles I #person began to dispute over their roles, Charles I, wanting to keep power to himself, disbanded parliament and arrested outspoken members.

Most of the people he arrested were the [[State Control of Religion#Puritans]] gentry. The Puritans took this as an attack on their political power and religious beliefs. As a result, under the leadership of Oliver Cromwell #person, a civil war broke out between the gentry and the king.

## Impacts of the Civil War
While Oliver Cromwell was successful in leading the gentry to victory, he was actually a worse tyrant than any other previous English King. Among his tyrannical actions were:
- The banning of all nobles from Parliament.
- The abolishment of the monarchy.
- Using military force to rule
- Making new, unfair laws

After Oliver Cromwellâ€™s death in 1658, Charles II took control of British government. However, many of Oliver Cromwell's changes remained. They included the rule that parliament could convene without being dismissed by the king, and were also now required to approve new taxes.
