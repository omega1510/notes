# Centralization of Power
---

> A centralized government is one in which both executive and legislative power is concentrated centrally at the higher level, as opposed to it being more distributed at various lower level governments.

## Spain and France
The first major powers in Europe to break the feudal cycle were Spain and France, as they began to centralize their states and dominate Italy and the rest of Europe. They went from being dominated by Muslims and local rulers to being the strongest European superpowers in a century. They began their centralization with the military, but soon expanded that to control taxes and religion.

In Spain, Ferdinand and Isabella #person united all Christians in Spain in the Inquisition against the Muslims and Jews and forced them out by 1492. In France, Charles VII created the first standing army for France, organizing and defeating their English and Burgundian opponents.

When Ferdinand and Isabella conquered Spain, they set up a new system that centralized power in primarily two ways:
- They gave more law-making and tax collection power to themselves
- They reduced the role and power of the nobles

In France, Charles VII set up the first ever united army run directly by him, as well as enhancing his tax privileges. By uniting the taxes and militaries of these large states, Spain and France soon found that this new money and power made them almost unstoppable in Europe. Both were able to invade and profit heavily from the Italian city-states, who were too localized and small to stand a chance on their own.

## Philip II #person
Centralization would root itself firmest and quickest in Spain. About a century after Ferdinand and Isabella, Philip II had become the king of Spain, and had almost complete control of lawmaking and power by the 1590s. In Spain, he determined the official religion (Catholicism), banning all others and sent the [[Catholic Counter-Reformation#Opposition to Protestants|Inquisition]] and soldiers to chase out all non-Catholics.

He developed a complex system of bureaucrats to collect taxes and run his vast kingdom, which now expanded to the New World. While most Catholic leaders had [[Catholic Counter-Reformation#Opposition to Protestants|laws]] against non-Catholics and collected taxes, none did so with the authority and scale of Philip II.

## Resistance to Centralization
Centralizing under the monarchy in Spain and France came at the expense of the power of the nobles, who traditionally had their own taxes, laws, and militaries. Both kingdoms experienced large-scale revolts in the early 1600s as nobles attempted to regain power.

### Catalan Revolt in Spain #war
In Spain, the area of Catalonia grew tired of fighting the endless wars of the Spanish king in Europe, as well as paying for the massive Spanish debt through the high, centralized taxes. With help from France, the nobles of Catalonia revolted and won. Catalonia then left Spain and the king lost complete control over the military and taxes in the region.

### Fronde Revolts in France #war
Nobles in France revolted to be rid of the monarchy’s high control over military and taxes. However, the monarchy quickly defeated them, increasing their control over taxes and the national army.

### Poland
Other European states began to centralize according to the Spanish and French model. However, when Sigismund I and II #person attempted to centralize power in Poland, the nobles refused to comply. They chose to elect kings and keep their privileges.

This would result in nobles exercising a large amount of local, decentralized control. Poland, like most of Eastern Europe, would forever remain decentralized and controlled by agricultural-based nobles, until deep into the [[Industrial Revolution]]. This would lead to Poland’s weakness in the coming conflicts with Russia, Prussia (state of Germany), and Austria a century later.
