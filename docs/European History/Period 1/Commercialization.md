## Price Revolution
The influx of New World goods and Spanish silver had a dramatic impact on Europe: the Price Revolution – a drastic increase in goods, money, and prices. Essentially, the massive flow of silver and American goods into Europe provided Europeans with plenty of disposable income. This, in return, drove the prices of goods up very quickly, including the price of food, which was in short supply due to inefficient farming methods.

To accommodate this, lords and governments increasingly closed off their land to the peasants to harvest more efficiently. As a result, landowners now became substantially more rich, especially the ones who fenced off and organized their land.

## Enclosure Movement
During the Middle Ages, European economies were dominated by peasant agriculture. Peasants were bound to the land of their lord, paying him taxes in grain, while being protected by the lord from hardship. The land they lived on was largely unorganized and called common land. Anyone could use it for farming, foraging, or hunting. ^a548b0

But, beginning in England in the 16th century, due to the Price Revolution, lords began to close off their land from the peasants to farm for large profits. Fences were built, and the peasants who remained were used in a more organized manner to plant and harvest crops.

This forced thousands of people into cities. Combined with the naturally rising population, this made cities very unprepared to handle large crowds.

## Commercialization in Europe
The Enclosure Movement was the beginning of commercialization in Europe – the harvesting and selling of crops by landowners for profit. Some new economic ideas, such as printed money, banks, loans, and credit had made their way to Europe through Italy.

No longer did simply having land mean you had power. You had to sell goods, and that meant commercializing agriculture. The peasants often rebelled when they were stripped of their peasant rights, however. **Kett’s Rebellion** in England was an example of this.

## Commercialization in Eastern Europe
While much of Western Europe was commercializing, most of Eastern Europe remained dependent on peasant agriculture. Poland, Hungary, and Russia all remained largely tied to serfdom. As a result, land-based nobles would hold the majority of the power and prevent Eastern Europe from growing economically.
