# Early Modern Society
---

## Public and Social Life
While governments had changed quite drastically, the way people relaxed, celebrated, and spent their free time remained largely the same. Leisure activities were still tied directly to the Church and agricultural cycle and still reflected the persistence of magic and folklore (All Saint’s Day, Christmas, Easter, etc.)

Events such as Carnaval and religious festivals revolving around harvest dominated popular life. Furthermore, large groups formed to watch blood sports, like bull-baiting and bear-baiting.

## City Life
With large amounts of people urbanizing due to the [[Commercialization#Enclosure Movement|Enclosure Movement]], cities and authorities were largely unprepared to handle the new, massive crowds. While cities offered men work as construction workers, food processors, and innkeepers, most people were unemployed and extremely poor.

Crime and disease was rampant in cities. Combined with a lack of sanitation or modern medicine, this made life miserable for residents. With the Church largely gone or irrelevant in [[Protestant Reformation|Protestant]] Europe, cities and governments were forced to enforce stricter laws on begging and prostitution and form secular local authorities.

Regardless, following the Enclosure Movement, cities overflowed as craft guilds and merchant elites strained private resources to govern and maintain order.

Despite this continuation, many [[Protestant Reformation|Protestant]] areas began to ban Carnival as an immoral practice.

## Witch Hunts
New secular governments were extremely superstitious believed in witchcraft, curses, blessings, potions, and magic. Many of them believed sickness and plague were either curses, hexes, or punishment for bad behavior or sin.

In fact, despite a [[Scientific Revolution|growing scientific community]], witch hunts and killings peaked in the late 1500s and early 1600s. Lastly, people also still believed actions such as volcanoes or comets in the sky were consequences of sins or omens of bad things to come.

## Livelihood
During the 16th and 17th centuries, most Eastern Europeans obtained livelihood from [[Commercialization#^a548b0|peasant agriculture]], paying rent and taxes to their lords. Most farms at the time relied on manual labor and used the three-crop farming rotation, leaving 1/3 of the soil unused.

Unfortunately for peasants, increases in population during the 16th century meant prices rose higher than wages. This caused peasant families to be poorer and reduced their standards of living.

## Marriage and Literacy
Following the [[Commercialization#Price Revolution|Price Revolution]], economic conditions raised living standards in cities.

Advances in education and harsh economic pressures delayed marriages, resulting in smaller families. This left fewer people around to use the money supply, and actually raised living standards, especially after the [[Thirty Years’ War]].

While the printing press helped spread literature, the vast majority of Europeans were still uneducated, illiterate peasants. However, the printing press did play a pivotal role in establishing vernacular languages.

## Families
Much like ancient families, peasant families worked in an egalitarian manner. While men did strength-oriented labor, women worked with the men doing separate but complementary tasks. 

Families worked and lived in small units, enjoying time together and living in small, well-known local communities.

### Women
The role of women did remain subordinate as the husband had total legal control over them. While women could inherit business and land, they could not expand either or train their own employees.

However, the [[Protestant Reformation]], [[Catholic Counter-Reformation]], and [[Italian Renaissance]] raised debates about female education. This debate was known as *La Querelle Des Femmes*.

*La Querelle Des Femmes* was a broad debate from the 1400s to the 1700s in Europe regarding the nature of women, their capabilities, and whether they should be permitted to study, write, or govern in the same manner as men. Some women, such as writer Christine de Pizan #person, wrote that women were as intelligent as men but were not afforded the same education.

[[Protestant Reformation|Protestant]] women also played a major part in the [[Protestant Reformation]] by offering funds to Protestant writers and princes who fought to defend Protestantism.

Women impacted the arts as well. An example of this is the famous [[Religious Art#Baroque Art|Baroque]] painter Artemisia Gentileschi #person.
