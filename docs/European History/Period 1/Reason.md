# Reason
---

[[Humanism]] in the [[Italian Renaissance]] used reason as a replacement for revelation. During that period, the new [[Capitalism]] class wanted to take power away from the church and establish rules and regulations that benefited them and their businesses. This push back against the Church took power away from them and put it in the hands of the new, rich elite. Under the guise of “reason”, the rich elite of the time subverted the Churches power for their own personal gain. ^e88cd2

## Skepticism
One of the ideas reborn in the [[Italian Renaissance]] was a concept called Greco-Roman logic and skepticism. These ideas were refined by Muslims and transferred to Renaissance Europe.

Skepticism means to doubt and question things that are accepted as true. It was applied to Greek, Roman, and Muslim knowledge. New inventions, technologies, and math provided a way to effectively test these ideas in the 16th century (e.g. telescopes, microscopes, vacuum pump, thermometers).

## Knowing Without Knowing
**Inductive reasoning**, created by Francis Bacon #person , uses evidence, patterns, and observations to supply strong evidence for a general truth.

**Deductive reasoning**, created by Descartes #person, uses logical deduction from general observations to make a certain, logical conclusion.

## Issues with Reason
There are two main problems with the true, unmanipulated meaning of reason:
- What is reason, and how can we assume that religious people did not use it?
- Humans are not fully free. Most of their choices are mediated, and they have no ultimate control over the world and their lives.

Furthermore, there are many things that we hold to be true, but cannot be proven through mathematics or testing. For example, the universality of the law of cause and effect cannot be proven through mathematics or testing; it is a logical truth that must be presupposed to make testing viable, an axiom.

Similarly, modern scientific theories like the theory of relativity assume that the speed of light is constant, but this can never be proven universally, yet we are all reasonable enough to accept that these axioms are true.
