# Religious Art
---

The 16th and 17th centuries were dominated by brutal power conflicts for religion and control of state in Europe ([[Thirty Years’ War]], [[State Control of Religion]], [[Charles V#Peace of Augsburg war| Schmalkaldic War]], [[Charles V#Dutch Revolts Eighty Years’ War war|Dutch Revolts]]). Painters and writers attempted to escape through their work and seek answers to old questions.

## Mannerist Art
Mannerist art came out of a desire to escape reality, rejecting the peace, accuracy, and serenity of [[Renaissance Art]]. This form of art included distortions in paintings, including color, shape, expression, and tone.

Painters like El Greco #person created unique and disturbing images with gloomy themes. Writers were disillusioned by the violence of Christian conflicts. Michael de Montaigne #person wrote about understanding one’s own morality, rather than Christianity.

## Baroque Art
The Church commissioned new art for the Vatican. The Baroque style focused on grandiose subjects and scenes that were meant to dazzle with spectacular displays, contrasts, and color (Caravaggio #person and Bernini #person).

The Catholic Church began hiring and using artists during the late 16th century to aid the growing [[Catholic Counter-Reformation]]. Like the writings of [[Catholic Counter-Reformation#^3eca78|Loyola and Avila]], they electrified the faithful with lavish religious images and events. [[Protestant Reformation|Protestant]] artists used the same color schemes, but rather emphasized glory (Rembrandt #person).
