# Charles V #person

The [[Catholic Counter-Reformation#Council of Trent|Council of Trent]] started many brutal conflicts from 1540 to 1648. Charles V, king of Spain and Holy Roman Emperor, took his armies into Protestant lands to reunite the Catholic Empire. His goal was to defeat and return the newly converted Protestant princes to Catholicism. He would eventually be successful, restoring Catholic unity in Europe in the 1540s.

## Peace of Augsburg #war
Primarily in the Holy Roman Empire, [[Capitalism|Capitalist]] princes wanted to be protestant so that they remained outside the Church’s sphere of influence. With the might of Spain behind him, Charles V was widely successful, but could not completely defeat them. A large alliance called the **Schmalkaldic League** resisted Charles V for over a decade.

Eventually, Charles V settled for peace in 1555, in a treaty called the Peace of Augsburg. The treaty allowed princes to choose between Protestantism and Catholicism, further weakening the Holy Roman Empire. The Peace of Augsburg was the first legal document confirming the legality of Protestantism; this only accelerated its growth to the point where nearly 40% of all Christians believed in it.

## Dutch Revolts (Eighty Years’ War) #war
[[Protestant Reformation#Calvinism Zwinglianism|Calvinism]] had spread like wildfire among the nobles of the Netherlands. When Phillip II officially outlawed all [[Protestant Reformation|Protestantism]] and sent the Inquisition to the Netherlands, the Dutch princes began the bloodiest revolt in European history: the Dutch Revolts, which lasted for 80 years. 3 Spanish monarchs fought the Dutch during this period, among them being Charles V and [[Centralization of Power#Philip II|Philip II]].  Although Charles V fought especially viciously, he had to concede when Spain ran out of money.
