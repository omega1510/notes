## Before the War
Following the Siege of Vienna in 1683, the weakened Ottoman Empire would be chased out of Europe over the next 50 years. Russia and Austria would grow at the expense of the Ottomans. Austria would successfully bring Hungary and the Slavic states back into the European spotlight.

After the Peace of Westphalia, the princes and provinces of the Holy Roman Empire gained more political and religious freedom. This growing sense of independence among the Holy Roman Empire caused many provinces to act as independent states. The best example of this is Prussia, who was reformed heavily under [[Absolutism#Frederick II of Prussia person|Fredrick II]].

Prussia’s rise to power can best be shown in 1740, when Frederick II refused to recognize the legitimacy of [[Absolutism#Joseph II person|Maria Theresa]]‘s rule over Austria. This caused the War of Austrian Succession #war, which Prussia won.

## Start of the War
Emboldened by their victory against Austria, Prussia wanted to take more land from Austrian rulers in Silesia. However, France and Russia came to the aid of Austria. But with the help of Britain, who wanted to weaken France, Prussia was able to gain victory.

It barely won because of 3 main reasons:
- Britain’s entry into the war provided aid and distracted the French.
- Fredrick II was a great military leader.
- the monarch of Russia died, and a pro-Prussian monarch came to power.

## Impacts of the War
- It solidified Prussia as a major power.
- It vastly expanded the British Empire.
- It established the sole control of India with the [[Mercantilism#^cd2cf5|British East India Company]].
- It demonstrated the importance of a strong Navy.
- It forced French Quebec into British Canada and put an economic and military strain on British colonies in North America.


### Conflicts in the Colonies
The real impact of the war came in India and North America. The British were seeking an opportunity to gain land from the French. The British exploited their naval power to take control of French colonies.

However, the French were superior on land but were trapped by the British Navy. Starved of money and supplies, the French gave most of their colonies to the British.
