# Congress of Vienna
---

Following [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]‘s defeat in the early 1800s, the monarchs and nobles of Europe wanted to return everything back to the way it had been done before. The nobles and clergy that survived got back their lands and power, and borders were returned to the way they were in 1792.

To make sure no nation was ever able to have a revolution and try to repeat Napoleon’s conquest, they formed an agreement. Led by Prince Metternich of Austria, the Congress of Vienna agreed that all continental kings would aid the others in case of a revolution. Their goal was to maintain their old systems and power, doing everything they could together to eliminate the impact of the [[Napoleon Bonaparte#Napoleon the Reformer|Napoleonic Code]].

This agreement was called the Concert of Europe.
