## Start of the Golden Age
Following their extrication from the suppressive control of the Spanish Empire after one phase of the [[Charles V#Dutch Revolts Eighty Yearsâ€™ War war|Dutch Revolts]], several provinces in the Netherlands established the Dutch Republic in 1609. While some areas of the Netherlands remained under Spanish control, the Dutch began to establish themselves in the world and usher in an era known as the Dutch Golden Age.

## During the Golden Age
the Dutch Golden Age was a period in the Netherlands, roughly spanning the 17th century, in which Dutch trade, science, military, and art were among the most acclaimed worldwide.

Politically, social status was largely determined by income. The nobility and clergy in the Dutch Republic had relatively little importance and unlike any other merchant class, the urban merchant class dominated Dutch society.

Wealthy merchants bought themselves into nobility. They also started to value public office as a path to power.
