# Late Modern Society
---

## Population Changes
By the 1700s, the plague had disappeared as a major epidemic and smallpox inoculations meant far more children survived till adulthood. De-emphasis on religion increased illegitimate births, but this was counteracted by [[Enlightenment#Romanticism|Romanticism]] changing marriage patterns by decreasing arranged marriages. Marrying for love actually delayed most marriages, resulting in having kids later in life and usually less of them. Additionally, early birth control began to be used more frequently (infanticide, killing nurses, abortions, etc.)

## Urban Issues
The growth of cities eroded traditional communal values, and city governments strained to provide protection and a healthy environment. Additionally, the close sense of community and closeness of rural peasants disappeared in a more impersonal and alienating urban setting. This created the need for a city and county police force as crime and population grew too fast.

The concentration of peasants in cities led to a greater awareness of poverty and prostitution as social problems. This resulted in new laws being passed in response:
- **The New Poor Law:** Formed Poor Law Unions and the building of workhouses in each union for the giving of poor relief that was paid by a “poor rate” tax on the property-owning middle class.
- **Contagious Diseases Acts:** Allowed police officers to arrest women suspected of being prostitutes in certain ports and army towns. The women were then subjected to compulsory checks for venereal disease. If a woman was declared to be infected, she would be confined in what was known as a lock hospital until she recovered or completed her sentence.

## Society
As commercial wealth increased, families dedicated more space and resources to children, child-rearing, and private comforts.

The upper class would frequent coffeehouses, theaters, and opera houses. Homes became new venues for leisure activities, such as novel reading and private emotion and reflection. Make-up, mirrors, wigs, and cosmetics became popular symbols of wealth.

Culturally, despite the [[Scientific Revolution]], some old ideas persisted, such as the field of alchemy. While key figures such as Paracelsus #person, the father of modern toxicology, had established the field in the [[Early Modern Society|Early Modern Era]], key figures such as Isaac Newton still looked to the potions and mixtures of alchemy for answers. While not upheld as a field across time, alchemy played a foundational role in human understanding of toxicology and many natural chemicals.

## Culture
During the late 18th century, the [[Enlightenment]] quest to categorize all knowledge expanded beyond Europe itself.

Carl Linnaeus #person began to categorize various species of plants, and later animals, with his taxonomic system. This resulted in many natural scientists exploring and recording discoveries across the world, which made their way back to a fascinated Europe.

Additionally, scientists and explorers began to log and track various people and cultures outside of Europe, which equally fascinated Europeans.

It became popular for the wealthy to purchase art and decorations inspired by Chinese style, along with greater demand for tea and silk.
