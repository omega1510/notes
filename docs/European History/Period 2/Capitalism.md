## Europe Before Capitalism: Mercantilism
![[Mercantilism#Mercantalism]]

### Putting-Out System
The putting-out system allowed peasants who needed extra money to work in their homes at a time before factories. With a large flow of cotton coming from slave plantations, textile companies had to distribute textile production. Peasants displaced by the [[Commercialization#Enclosure Movement|Enclosure Movement]] began using raw materials from the Americas to weave in their own homes. This provided regular people with more money and increased living standards.

## Laissez-Faire Capitalism
Seeing this massive growth of wealth in Europe, **Adam Smith** codified a new economic theory in his book, ***Wealth of Nations***, in 1776. He advocated for “free market” economics, with no guild or government interference. This would allow more trade at lower costs, bringing down market prices. 

If people were able to make what they want, they would make what other people wanted and compete for business. This competition, combined with supply and demand, would ensure low prices, high quality, and no need for government or guilds interfering in the economy. In other words, monetary incentives would regulate the economy on its own, allowing freedom and creativity.
