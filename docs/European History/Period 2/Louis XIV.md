## Louis XIV’s Approach to Nobles
After experiencing the turmoil of the [[Centralization of Power#Fronde Revolts in France war|Fronde]], Louis XIV made sure to keep nobles close to him and loyal to his power. To do this, he made sure to let them keep their local authority. He made nobles stronger by assigning them to run his government. Nobles ran the bureaucracy, collected taxes, and were officers of the new, state-controlled military.

The intendant system was established and used to divide the state into districts, which were administered by a central intendant. This system was also expanded to Spain in 1711.

King Louis XIV physically moved all the nobles to the newly built Palace of Versailles. He also commissioned artists and authors to paint, sculpt, and write about his leadership and censor negativities.

## Jean-Baptiste Colbert #person
Louis XIV’s success can partially be attributed to his brilliant Chief Minister and Administrator of Finance, Jean-Baptiste Colbert.

Colbert discovered that less than half of taxes made it to the King, so he helped design and structure the central government for Louis XIV. This made sure all taxes were gathered and distributed correctly.

He also balanced the French budget and protected France from bankruptcy. He also restructured the French economy and drafted plans to boost French manufacturing and keep jobs in the country by purchasing locally.

> It is simply, and solely, the abundance of money within a state \[which] makes the difference in its grandeur and power.

> The art of taxation consists in so plucking the goose as to obtain the largest \[number] of feathers with the least possible amount of hissing.

– Jean-Baptiste Colbert

## Control of France
Louis XIV and Jean-Baptiste Colbert brought France under centralized control in the following ways:
- **Administration:** Taxes and finance all came to Louis XIV’s bureaucracy, and were managed by loyal nobles who maintained their local rights.
- **Military:** Modeling after [[Centralization of Power#Philip II person|Phillip II]] and [[Centralization of Power#Spain and France|Charles VII]], Louis XIV formed one standing French Army, officered by the loyal nobility.
- **Laws:** Louis XIV had final lawmaking power, and any who resisted or rebelled were crushed by the French Military.
- **Religion:** Louis XIV made France officially Catholic by revoking the [[State Control of Religion#Religious Pluralism|Edict of Nantes]] and forcing out remaining Huguenots.
- **Art:** All art was regulated by Royal Academies and was used to portray things positively.
