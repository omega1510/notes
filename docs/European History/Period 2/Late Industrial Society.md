# Late Industrial Society
---

## Family and Gender Roles
Working class families were often forced to work entirely, and rather than work as family units like they had as peasants, their labor was split in [[Factory System|factories]]. This often meant there was less family connection, and adolescents would often leave the household as soon as financially able.

### Middle Class Families
Middle class families, on the other hand, tended to become more unified and pampered. Middle class men tended to be the hard-working breadwinners and focused almost entirely on financial gain and public involvement. Women and children in the middle class were to stay at home, as the mother raised, educated, and cared for the kids.

#### Women
With high crime and prostitution rates in cities, middle class women were seen as a moral example for a proper, civilized society, and were supposed to behave as such. They taught children manners and educated them in academic, musical, and moral standings.

Women who were able to stay at home without working became a symbol of high social status. Social status became a measure of how little a family (other than the father) worked, and the more leisure time a family had, the higher status they were.

## Consumerism
Additionally, in the late 19th century, families had far more disposable income to use, and advances in manufacturing created a larger amount of goods at far cheaper prices. Along with [[Capitalism]] creating wealth through the multiplier effect and investment, goods after the [[Second Industrial Revolution]] were far cheaper and more available.

This increase in wages often left the new middle class, especially the lower middle class, with far more disposable income to spend on non-necessities. The middle class was determined to separate itself from the working class and emulate the lifestyle of the upper middle class and aristocracy as closely as possible. 

As a result, consumerism increased substantially, as the middle class attempted to appear more wealthy, buying watches, glasses, clothes, furniture, and other luxury items.

## New Society
Another impact on society was the invention of more commercial goods, as well as advances in preserving goods, like food and drink. Canned goods, combined with preservative chemicals, salt, and refrigerated [[Railroads|rail cars]] now allowed for food to be stored for long periods of time.

Better factories and cheaper transportation and production costs allowed for cheaper textiles, which let people buy more and more clothes and other goods. New inventions like soap and other hygiene goods improved overall health and cleanliness.

Finally, leisure activities began to include large parks and theaters, and middle class families had the time and money to visit them, as well as pay for new leisure activities like museums. New forms of entertainment like organized and professional sports developed with this new leisure time, such as basketball, tennis, and golf. They became symbols of high social status, even sparking entirely new industries for supplies and audiences.

## Advertising and Department Stores
Another new development that heightened consumerism was catalogs and department stores. For the first time, businesses and companies had the money and technology to promote their products far outside their own stores via mail. The development of purchasable advertisements for products like clothes, cigarettes, glasses, shoes, etc., in newspapers and magazines vastly increased demand.

Companies like Montgomery Ward and Sears in the United States developed catalogs, which offered the latest and newest line of products, and made them cheaply available to far more people.

Lastly, new businesses called department stores began to develop a one-stop shopping experience. These new department stores provided consumers with a wide range of cheap products to choose from, vastly increasing consumption.
