# Absolutism
---
Following the 17th century, European states began to [[Centralization of Power|centralize]] more and more under the models of France, Spain, and Sweden. After the reign of [[Centralization of Power#Philip II person|Phillip II]], a new movement began: absolutism.

Absolutism drew its authority from the “Divine Right of Kings”. This stated that the King had power through God, and therefore could act with complete and unquestionable authority. Phillip II became a role model for other kings, especially [[Louis XIV]].

## James I of England #person 
One monarch who admired Phillip II was James I. He believed dearly in the Divine Right, and thought others should accept his laws and policies without question.

He disbanded [[Gentry#^39c040|Parliament]] when they refused to pay him personally a large portion of taxes. For this reason, he ruled alone and acquired funds through the sale of land and titles.

## Enlightened Absolutism
With the Spanish, French, Portuguese, Dutch, and English thriving, Eastern Europe began to take notice. Prussia, Austria, and Russia would all attempt to be more western as they tried to bring nobles and finance under control.

To become more western, they:
- [[Centralization of Power|Centralized Government]]
- [[Commercialization|Commercialized]]
- Improved military and technology
- Adopted western culture

### Peter the Great of Russia #person 
Peter the Great followed a western model, but also maintained complete control of the government (no [[Gentry#^39c040|Parliament]]). He moved all his nobles close to him by force and made them part of his government.

He reformed the military under the Prussian model, using nobles as officers, and vastly expanded Russian territory to the East and against Poland. Furthermore, he attempted to mimic Louis XIV by building an entire city (St. Petersburg) and the lavish Winter Palace.

Peter the Great established the Russian Academy of Science in 1725, which expanded Russian knowledge and adopted western culture. Finally, he used conquest to open up ports and [[Commercialization|commercialize]].

### Catherine the Great #person 
Peter’s successor Catherine the Great continued to bring about reforms.
- She enhanced education in Russia and started state schools for women
- She patronized [[Enlightenment]] art and writers.
- She began to remove the Eastern Orthodox Church from the Russian state by selling their lands.
- She gave nobles more freedom and required less government participation.
- She reinforced serfdom and made the Russian economy dependent on it.
- She continued to expand Russia to the east against Poland and the decaying Ottoman Empire.

### Frederick II of Prussia #person
Prussia was very successful at modernizing under the enlightened monarch Frederick II. he was educated and fond of western government and religion. Frederick believed that a monarch could have complete control and use that power to protect and serve the people.

Prussia modernized in the following ways:
- Nobles were used in government and kept their rights (similar to [[Louis XIV]])
- The military followed the French with appointed officers.
- Religious tolerance was initiated in the state.

### Joseph II #person
Another enlightened monarch, Joseph II of Austria, also attempted to Westernize, but focused instead on changing laws and education after his mother, Maria Theresa #person. Maria had tried but failed to centralize the nobles in Hungary, who refused to cooperate against the Ottoman Empire.

So instead, her son Joseph II made many [[Enlightenment]]-inspired changes to the Holy Roman Empire:
- He initiated religious toleration in Austria.
- He started compulsory education for elementary boys.
- He freed the serfs as the peasants had been in the West (didn’t last).
- He reformed the legal system to respect many individual rights.

Despite failing to reform Austria, Austrian power grew substantially thanks to the conquests of Poland and Ottoman Empire in Southern and Eastern Europe.
