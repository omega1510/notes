## Problems Following the [[French Revolution]]
While the French had succeeded in forming their new government, they experienced a slight amount of trouble in fighting all of Europe at once. To combat the coalitions, the French instituted a *levee en masse* to draft the largest army of its age. This was necessary as there were no kings or nobles to contribute an army.

While their massive conscription army of 750,000 was doing well, especially under the brilliant general [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], their economy was unstable. Already riddled with debt and stripped of colonies from earlier conflicts, the British had cut the French off from the world with their navy, and food and money at home were scarce.

When the peasants and citizens became restless, [[Louis XIV]] attempted to flee and fight against France. This caused things to take a turn for the worst.

## Jacobins
To keep peace in Paris, the government turned to the Jacobins. They were an extremely radical and militaristic part of the revolution. Their leader was a man named Maximilien Robespierre #person.

Unfortunately for the republic, the Jacobins were far more radical than they had thought, and they began to impose their radical ideas on France. They allied themselves with the *sans-culottes* (without breeches), a radical militant group of regular people who were against royalty and nobility, and quickly began to purge moderates who opposed their violent ways.

The first major group to succumb to their violent purge was the moderate Girondins: a political group that were initially a part of the Jacobin movement.

Most famously, the Jacobins considered anyone who questioned the government or ideas a traitor, and imprisoned and executed thousands without a trial. When the republic government spoke out against the actions of Robespierre and the Jacobins, they turned on the government, labelling them as anti-revolutionaries. The Jacobins then imposed censorship, and imprisoned/executed all political opponents.

## France under Robespierre
In September 1792, a massive purge began as the Jacobins killed thousands of prisoners and targeted anyone who dressed lavishly. They proceeded to behead and drown thousands more suspected criminals across France, accusing them of being anti-Revolutionary.

Maximilien Robespierre declared a state of emergency and formed the committee of public safety, which officially suspended all natural rights and protections. Initially headed by Georges Danton #person, a key revolutionary figure who helped to establish the constitutional republic and public education, the Committee soon turned on itself, beheading Danton for allegedly being too lenient on enemies of the Revolution.

Economically, in an attempt to help peasants, he used the government to control food by fixing the prices of goods and the wages of workers, as well as banishing all fancy clothes as being too aristocratic.

Lastly, they attempted to control morality and religion by banning all religion, especially Christianity, and invented an entirely new, non-religious calendar.

## The Thermidorian Reaction
Plagued by The Reign of Terror, a group called the Directory (5 men with executive power) drew support, rose up, overthrew, and executed Robespierre and the leaders of the Jacobin party in July 1794. This event was known as the Thermidorian Reaction.

The new government attempted to run France, but were not popular enough to maintain power with food and financial problems. In an attempt to make themselves more popular, they made the mistake of including the famous national general [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]. Napoleon, knowing how popular he was, initiated a plebiscite (nation-wide vote) to name himself the head of the government. With a vote of 3,000,000 to 1592, Napoleon was declared the Head of State of France. Soon after, he declared himself Emperor.

## Impact of the Terror
While Britain, the U.S., and many pro-[[Enlightenment]] figures had supported the French Revolution, they quickly changed their minds after the Reign of Terror. The beheading, drowning, censorship, [[Humanism#Secularism|secularization]], and other policies were seen as the opposite of the enlightenment. The Terror actually made the idea of revolution in Europe even more unpopular, giving European states more reason to fight France.

Writers like Edmund Burke #person in England opposed violent revolution, insisting changes like England’s happen over time, not immediately. He successfully predicted the chaos and disorder that would follow the abrupt upheaval of a centuries-long society, even before the Reign of Terror.

Regardless of how they felt, Europe would soon be faced with France’s changes as Napoleon would quickly set his sights on spreading Revolutionary ideals.
