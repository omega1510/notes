## Mechanization in the [[Industrial Revolution]]
Mechanization means to replace human workers with machines. This is what kickstarted the [[Industrial Revolution]], allowing European manufacturing of textiles to surpass China and India. The first example of this was in 1760 with the spinning jenny and the water frame â€“ they took slow, ineffective human textile production and mechanized it.

## Mechanization in the [[Second Industrial Revolution]]
While the textile industry was optimized, the bulk of manufacturing was still done by human labor. Although labor was organized into the [[Factory System]] from the domestic system to speed up production, it was still inefficient.

However, Germany revolutionized production by harnessing and developing electricity to mechanize the [[Factory System]] even further. Larger, more complex equipment reduced or eliminated human workers, who were limited and ineffective. This cut accidents and costs and produced cheaper goods faster than before. New industries were developed as companies produced automobiles, drilling, construction, and various chemicals like peaches and soaps (chemical soaps were still inferior to the natural fat varieties).
