# Absolutism in England
---

## James II #person 
As opposed to the rest of Europe, England and the Dutch Republic furthered the power of representative assemblies ([[Gentry#^39c040|Parliament]]) instead of kings. The [[Gentry]] in England had been a very powerful force in the government through parliament since the [[English Civil War]].

James II wanted, like monarchs before him, to rule as an absolute monarchy. He also happened to be Catholic, and was very clear in his actions that he intended to give Catholics more power and privilege.


## Glorious Revolution #war
When James II began dismissing judges and military officials and replacing them with Catholics, the largely [[Church of England|Anglican]] and [[Centralization of Power#Resistance to Centralization|Puritan]] Parliament became concerned. Given James II’s ambitions, Parliament feared a Catholic takeover was lining up.

To remedy the situation, and remove James II, Parliament invited the Dutch stateholder William of Orange #person to invade England and take the throne. They promised to send their forces and supplies to the aid of William only if William agreed to their terms to limit his power and increase theirs. William agreed to these terms, and when he arrived with his army, a large portion of James’ army defected to William’s side.

Fearing for his life, James fled to France, where his big cousin, Louis XIV, protected him and gave him a castle.

## Parliament’s Protections
The two things that concerned the [[Gentry]] the most were liberty and property. They thought that the rights of the individual and their money, businesses, and land should be protected against the government arbitrarily taking it away. Furthermore, these rights should not be alienated without the consent of the governed.

With these in mind, Parliament made reforms designed to make sure the king or government could not violate these rights without due process.

## English Reforms
Two major anti-absolutist reforms were made in England after the Glorious Revolution:
- **Parliamentary sovereignty:** Parliament was an equal part of the government and could make or reject their own laws, without approval from the king.
- **English Bill of Rights:** 
	- Guaranteed freedom of speech for Members of Parliament.
	- Eliminated cruel and unusual punishment, requiring trial by jury.
	- Limited the monarch’s power and established free elections for Parliament.

England had therefore made the first official constitutional government by creating a limited, constitutional monarchy and a protection of people’s rights.
