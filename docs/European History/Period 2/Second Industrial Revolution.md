# Second Industrial Revolution
---
While the first [[Industrial Revolution]] centered on steam, coal, and textile production in Britain, the second one centered primarily in Germany.

## Germany in the Second Industrial Revolution
After the unification of German States, the new German government invested heavily into industrialization. Prussia, the most industrially developed of the former German states, spread its policies and attitude towards industrialization throughout Germany. The country invested in [[Railroads]] to connect the new German Empire and provide transportation for passengers and economic cargo.

They also focused heavily on the development of chemicals like sulfuric acid, bleaches, petroleum (gasoline), and also developed the Bessemer process for cheaper, solid steel.

## Economic Connectivity
By the late 1800s, Europe was much more connected than it had been previously. Telegraphs and telephones connected people and businesses, making communication and economic transactions far quicker.

[[Railroads]] made passage around countries faster, cheaper, and safer, resulting in cheaper manufacturing costs and militaristic advantages. In the **Franco-Prussian War**, Germanyâ€™s superior rail network allowed for better troop and supply movement.

In the late 19th century, the internal combustion engine was invented and new concepts like cars and planes began to emerge from Germany and the United States.

Steel ships would allow large amounts of supplies and passengers to cross the ocean, making the transportation of people and goods far cheaper, faster, and safer.
