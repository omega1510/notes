# Agricultural Revolution

## Physiocrats
Groups like the Physiocrats in France advocated for the organization and enhancement of agriculture for profit, rather than [[Mercantilism]]. They believed that economies should focus on developing cheap and effective labor to sell agricultural goods for more than it costs to make them.

Rather than focusing on wealthy rulers or balanced trade, they argued that [[Capitalism]] was the best way to make a nation wealthy.

Since manufacturing was still small-scale in the 17th and 18th centuries, agriculture was the larges economic category. This encouraged more landowners outside Great Britain to close off their land. This was known as the [[Commercialization#Enclosure Movement|Enclosure Movement]].

## British Agricultural Revolution
New food from the New World and the [[Commercialization#Enclosure Movement|Enclosure Movement]] also provided far more food for Europeans, causing large-scale population growth.

Owners could use more productive agricultural techniques without interference or trampling. Convertible Husbandry replaced three-crop rotation, allowing the entire field to be used, increasing agricultural output. Farmers now planted clovers, turnips, and livestock manure to increase production.

The rapid rise in food supply and population has led historians to label this spike in agricultural production as the British Agricultural Revolution.
