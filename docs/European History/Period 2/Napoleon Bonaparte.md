## Napoleon the Conqueror
Napoleon was a nearly unbeatable general in France after the [[French Revolution]]. He had the respect and unquestionable loyalty of his army, who were extremely experienced and efficient.

One by one, Napoleon took out the Italian provinces, Spain, Austria, The Holy Roman Empire, Prussia, and scared Russia into exiting the fight. By 1805, Napoleon and France had conquered or made allies out of all of Europe, marking the first time anyone had ever controlled the continent.

Unable to invade Britain, Napoleon banned all European trade with the British in the Continental System. As a response, the British also had France blockaded.

## Napoleon the Reformer
While Napoleon was in charge, he wanted to seem like he was continuing the themes of the Revolution, when in reality, only a few aspects would remain the same. Wanting to be like late Roman or Byzantine emperors, he enacted the Concordat of 1801, which made the Catholic Church the favored religion and provided the Church with state funding.

He started the first state education systems designed to educate a large range of French citizens.

However, Napoleon was a big fan of equality and earning what you have, so he created a Civil Code, also known as the Napoleonic Code, for France. Key reforms put in place by the Civil Code included:
- Elimination of nobility and their land and privileges
- Religious freedom
- Common law for the entire nation
- Equal treatment under the law

## Napoleon the Dictator
While Napoleon was true to equality before the law, he was not equal with his law. Women had no legal property or divorce rights, and husbands could imprison their wives for adultery, but not vice versa. He also invoked censorship, limiting what could or couldn’t be said about him.

While he did not execute political enemies, he made sure to quickly exile or deport anyone against him or his policies with a secret police force.

Finally, he reintroduced slavery to the Caribbean and temporarily occupied Haiti in an effort to retake the island. French forces were, however, thwarted by tropical disease, and Haitian forces aided by the United States and Great Britain.

## Napoleon’s Policies
While Napoleon had indeed violated many of the Enlightenment and Revolution’s ideals, he enthusiastically forced several of his favorite policies on conquered areas. In 1806, he officially and finally dissolved the Holy Roman Empire.

He also forced his Civil Code on all conquered territories and forced allies. This had a profound effect, as nobles and kings across Europe lost all of their traditional privileges.

All citizens were granted religious freedom (except for Islam and sometimes Judaism), as well as equal treatment and common laws, with no special privileges for clergy or nobility.

## The Fall of Napoleon
The problem for Napoleon was his Continental System. It was impossible to enforce, and the British Navy was still able to trade with other Europeans. The British also helped Spanish guerilla fighters in Spain to slowly drain French resources.

When Russia began openly trading with Britain, Napoleon invaded Russia with the entire French Army. The Russians, much like the Spanish, did not fight directly, instead using guerilla tactics and scorched earth tactics. They burned Russian towns and food to starve and freeze the French Army during the winter.

With no food, warm clothes, and being harassed by Russian soldier hit-and-runs, Napoleon had to retreat back to France, losing more than half his army.

A weak France gave the rest of Europe a chance to unite once again and invade France, which they did, conquering and exiling Napoleon in 1814. While he did return briefly to muster an army, a defeat at Waterloo in 1815 by Great Britain and Prussia kept Napoleon from spreading his empire or influence again.

After Napoleon, the monarchs of Europe met as the [[Congress of Vienna]] to return everything back to normal.
