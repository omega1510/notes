# Socialism
---

Socialism was originally formed to protect the working class’s rights during [[Early Industrial Society]]. Socialists believed that the middle class was exploiting others for financial gain and power. They thought that the government needed to step in and provide protection for the working class. ^702e06

## Utopian Socialism
Utopian Socialists believed that it was the moral duty of society to provide equal protection and treatment for all classes. They received the brand of “utopian” because their ideas seemed too naive and too idealistic.

### Saint-Simon
Saint-Simon was a proponent of utopian socialism. He believed that the working class was the most important because they were doing the physical work and labor to benefit others. To him, the working class should be praised and protected by the government for their contribution to the economy and society.

### Charles Fourier
Charles Fourier thought that factory and labor tasks should be divided according to what the workers were passionate about. This way, small communities would balance work and pleasure to produce the necessary goods, be self-sufficient, and be happy.

### Robert Owen
Robert Owen was a socialist factory owner who developed a revolutionary factory system that provided better pay, housing, and benefits for workers. He shortened the work day, enhanced child care, and made sure workers were healthy and happy. Amazingly, his factory ran smoothly and profitably, shocking critics of utopian socialism.

## Government Intervention
Increased awareness of the working class’ poor conditions led to the government making changes to protect workers. In Britain, several laws were passed to protect the working class:
- **Factory Act of 1833** – No children under 9 could work at textile mills and no children under 18 could work at night
- **Mines Act of 1842** – No children under 10 could work underground in mines.
- **Ten Hours Act of 1847** – The working day was limited to 10 hours for women and children in textile mills.

New “conservatives” like Napoleon III (nephew of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]) and Bismarck provided protections like the legalization of strikes, injury insurance, and retirement in order to appease the working class.
