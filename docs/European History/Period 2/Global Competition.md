# Global Competition
---

Throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, rivalry and competition continued throughout the world. Seeking to exploit a declining Spain and Portugal, the Dutch, British, and French chiseled away at American colonies, established colonies, forts, and naval bases in the Caribbean. They also engaged in piracy against one another in an effort to reduce and steal rival trade as part of [[Mercantilism]].

In the Indian Ocean, the British and Dutch fleets, along with the efforts of [[Mercantilism#^cd2cf5|charter companies]], secured control of India and the East Indies, respectively.

While the British and Dutch competed, the greatest emergent rivalry of the era was Britain and France. During conflicts like the [[Seven Years' War]], the British blockaded France and captured the majority of their colonial holdings.

In an effort to spite the British, the French provided funds, as well as direct military support, to the Continental Army against the British during the American Revolutionary War.
