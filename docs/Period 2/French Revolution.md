# French Revolution
---

## Before the Revolution
France and monarch [[Louis XIV]] were very unpopular by 1789. Long and short term issues made the king and the nobles very unpopular, especially with the spread of Enlightenment ideals and royal attempts to censor them.

**Long Term:** Louis XIV’s wars, the [[Seven Years' War]], and [[Global Competition]] left France bankrupt. [[Enlightenment]] ideals had also spread throughout the country.

**Short Term:** Famine and tax increases strained regular people, while clergy and nobles paid no taxes.

Knowing that people were restless and on the verge of revolt, Louis XVI called together the Estates General (France’s [[Gentry#^39c040|Parliament]]) to vote for reforms. However, the Estates general was heavily biased towards the nobles and clergy:
- First Estate (1%): Clergy
- Second Estate (1%): Nobles
- Third Estate (98%): Bourgeoisie (regular people and [[Gentry]])

### Reforms
To make the people of France happy, Louis XVI would model the government as a [[Absolutism in England|Constitutional Monarchy]]. The people wanted a constitution protecting their natural rights, equal taxes, and an estates general that was fair to the population. Louis XVI offered to meet all of these demands, except the last one; he wanted to keep the Estates General the same.

When the Third Estate refused, Louis XVI was angered and locked them out of the palace and chamber. At this point, the people rebelled, gathered weapons, and a mob of peasant women marched on Versailles and forced Louis XVI back to Paris.

## Liberal Changes
With the king held captive, the Third Estate now controlled the government. They made two progressive changes:
- **The Civil Constitution of the Clergy:** This reduced the power of the Church by selling all Church lands and titles, established religious freedom, and made marriage a state issue.
- **The Constitution of 1791:** All nobles were made regular citizens. All former noble lands were divided into governmental districts. Furthermore, it separated the powers of the government and included all male citizens in voting.

## [[Enlightenment]] Ideals
While drafting a constitution, they added the *Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen*, which added many Enlightenment and American Revolution ideals:
- Guaranteed freedom of speech and religion.
- Fair trial by jury.
- Established a republic with all men able to vote.
- Protected private property.

There were, however, no mention of women’s rights, despite their role in the Revolution itself. This prompted some women, such as Olympe de Gouges #person, to write the *Declaration of the Rights of Women and of the Female Citizen* #book to point out the hypocrisy in the new French government.

## Impact of the Revolution
The French Revolution is considered one of the most important events in human history. Not only was it intended for France, but the revolution and the people of France looked to spread their ideas across the world. It inspired revolutions in Haiti and Latin America, as well as abolished slavery in the French Empire.

France is also the first state in history to initiate massive conscription armies, which it would use to spread its ideals to the rest of Europe under [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]. This would, unfortunately for France, cause an interchanging series of European coalitions that built up against it, which consisted of Great Britain, Prussia, Austria, and Russia starting in 1790 – an event that would eventually harm the Revolution.

## After the Revolution
Immediately following the Revolution, the [[Reign of Terror]] began in the new French Republic.
