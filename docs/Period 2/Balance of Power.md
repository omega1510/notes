# Balance of Power
---

By the time [[Louis XIV]] centralized France as an absolutist, France was the undisputed number one power in Europe. However, since the [[Thirty Years’ War]], European states had generally agreed to a balance of power diplomacy, which meant allying against the dominant side.

This would result in two wars where Louis XIV attempted to expand the already powerful French state against its opponents in Europe. In both cases, France eventually lost to massive coalitions.

## Nine Years’ War
[[Louis XIV]] invaded the Holy Roman Empire (run by Austria) to expand France. England, Scotland, the Dutch Republic, Spain, and Sweden all united against France.

Despite the odds, France was actually better on the field, however the English and Dutch navies strangled the French economy. The result was an essential stalemate, with France stuck and stranded in Europe, and Alliance forces unable to invade France. After 9 years, they greed to stop, and prevented Louis XIV’s campaign.

## Wars of Spanish Succession #war
In the 1700s, the King of Spain died without an heir, naming Phillip V #person the king - the nephew of [[Louis XIV]]. Europeans rose up in opposition to this decision when Louis used this relationship to his advantage. He arranged exclusive trade benefits with Spain and also negotiated a future union of the two massive empires.

Once this information was leaked, England, Austria, Prussia, and Portugal all declared war on them. The fighting mainly took place around the borders of France, and neither side could secure a major advantage.

After 13 years of draining resources, both sides agreed to call for peace, with France losing minor territory and canceling any future unions with Spain.
