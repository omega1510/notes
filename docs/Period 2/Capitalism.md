## Europe Before Capitalism: Mercantilism
![[Mercantilism#Mercantilism]]

### Putting-Out System
The putting-out system allowed peasants who needed extra money to work in their homes at a time before factories. With a large flow of cotton coming from slave plantations, textile companies had to distribute textile production. Peasants displaced by the [[Commercialization#Enclosure Movement|Enclosure Movement]] began using raw materials from the Americas to weave in their own homes. This provided regular people with more money and increased living standards.

## Laissez-Faire Capitalism
Seeing this massive growth of wealth in Europe, **Adam Smith** codified a new economic theory in his book, ***Wealth of Nations***, in 1776. He advocated for “free market” economics, with no guild or government interference. This would allow more trade at lower costs, bringing down market prices. 

If people were able to make what they want, they would make what other people wanted and compete for business. This competition, combined with supply and demand, would ensure low prices, high quality, and no need for government or guilds interfering in the economy. In other words, monetary incentives would regulate the economy on its own, allowing freedom and creativity.

## Growth of Capitalism
Banking and capitalist policies caused an unexpectedly rapid period of economic growth in Europe during the 18th and 19th centuries. More developed banking and investment led to the creation of new money through loans, deposits, and spending. This was called the “multiplier effect”.

This allowed people to make and spend more money, and governments to become more and more wealthy from taxes. As a result, European economies skyrocketed, and wages, money, and standards of living rose for all Western Europeans. This also caused militaries to grow stronger and infrastructure began to improve.

## Pro-Capitalist Policies
Witnessing the success of free market economics, governments started making changes to facilitate free trade and capitalism. For example, in France, the *Le Chapelier Laws* in 1791 officially banned all guilds in France.

Laissez-faire trade rose, and governments, especially Britain, began to reduce tariffs. Governments began to remove price controls and Parliaments, mostly made of [[Gentry]], increased protections on private property. Property was now owned by tenants, not leased by the king. Therefore, the monarchy could only take property with a fair trial.

### Pro-Capitalism Laws
Great Britain’s and the Netherlands’ [[Gentry]] government removed limitations on manufacturing, such as guilds and tariffs. People moved freely, working or investing in whatever they were passionate about. Additionally, governments began to provide monetary incentives (Nobel Prize), as well as patents to protect inventor rights.

#### Corn Laws
One of the best examples of this approach was when they repealed the Corn Laws (a tariff on grains). A potato fungus from the Americas came to Europe in the 1840s, devastating the key crop in Northern and Western Europe. This caused massive famines, especially in Ireland, resulting in mass death and emigration to the United States.

Irish, Welsh, and Scottish citizens hoped to purchase chap grain from other countries to make up for the loss of grain. The Corn Laws prevented this from happening. In the 1830s and 1840s, [[Chartism|Chartists]] led speeches, rallies, protests, and obtained thousands of signatures from citizens in petitions to submit to Parliament in the hopes that they may reduce this series of tariffs. They started the Anti-Corn League and organized protests across Europe. Out of fear of losing their seats, Members of Parliament removed the Corn Laws to allow for better trade and cheaper grain in times of famine.

## Criticisms of Free Trade
While free trade could certainly benefit companies and consumers with cheaper products, it also created economic crashes and downturns. One of the key components of capitalism was market prices, rather than governments or guilds controlling prices. However, this also meant prices would rise and fall wildly based on demand, and with free trade, any drop or increase in prices affected all nations.

For example, when the Austria stock market crashed, several Austrian banks failed as well. Unemployment was widespread, which resulted in a massive economic downturn called the Panic of 1873. This caused price drops and unemployment in the US and Europe for 10 years.

This economic drop in prices and wages resulted in large amounts of unemployment across Europe, and caused countries to question free trade.

## Protectionism
Following numerous market failures, crashes, and famines, the governments of Europe began to abandon laissez-faire policies between one another int he 1870s. Prussian-American Friedrich List #person devised the National System in an effort to support free trade and free market economics, but protect domestic industry and goods by reintroducing select tariffs. This concept became known as protectionism.

List argued that some state intervention was necessary to stimulate economic growth, but warned not to be overzealous. This meant the return of many tariffs that had disappeared in the early-mid 1800s, starting mostly with Bismark in Germany, and soon including all of Europe except Britain.

One example was in Germany in 1879, when Bismark and German landowners established the Tariff Agreement of 1879. This tariff was a tax on imported grain to protect German agriculture, as grain prices on imports from the US and Russia were driving German farms out of business.

## Monopolies
One of the policies held by governments in the mid-19th century was the support of large monopolies, or companies that controlled an entire industry. As governments began to support tariffs in the 1870s to prevent the negative impact of free trade, they also began to support monopolies.

Governments and corporations believed that one strong, consistent company controlling an industry would make it more stable. When economic downturns occurred, smaller businesses went out of business and made problems worse, while many larger businesses survived.

Examples of state-supported. Monopolies can best be seen in the United States, with companies like Standard Oil controlling oil prices.

In Europe, powerful merchant and production families, such as the Krupp family in Germany, dominated manufacturing until the 1950s. The Krupp family had begun making weapons in the [[Thirty Years’ War]] and continued doing so until after World War II.
