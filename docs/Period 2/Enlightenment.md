## Influence of the [[Scientific Revolution]]
In the 18th century, the foundations of the scientific revolution were taken a step further. Thinkers known as _philosophes_ took those same principles of questioning authority and now focused on human institutions in politics, society, and economics rather than merely the physical sciences.

This was an era in France where [[Absolutism]] reigned supreme, that the monarch was the unquestionable authority.

## Challenging Religion
### The Encyclopedia
A man named Denis Diderot #person’s quest for knowledge in the 18th century led him to consolidate all knowledge of science and understanding in to one single source, known as the Encyclopedia #book. He and other _philosophes_ agreed to not include anything that could not be proven scientifically with evidence.

However, a problem arose when they came to topics of religion: Christianity could not offer any evidence to back it. Most of Christianity relied heavily on visions, old documents, and blind faith.

### Voltaire #person 
One of the key figures to first question and oppose the idea of religion all together was a Frenchman named Voltaire. He did not suggest that God did not exist, but that religion, along with its rules and traditions, had no factual basis. In fact, Voltaire also argued that organized religion was actually a negative thing, as it split groups and started hundreds of bloody conflicts.


## Changing Social Thought
Once _philosophes_ had begun to question God and religion as an authority, this challenged the view that monarchs receive their absolutist authority through God. To people like Voltaire, religion was considered a private issue. Now, absolutist monarchs were selfish.

Furthermore, Cesare Beccaria #person questioned the justice system in 1764. In his work on _On Crimes and Punishments_ #book, Beccaria argued in favor of prisons and punishments. he is considered the father of modern criminal law and criminal justice.

> Crimes are more effectually prevented by the certainty than the severity of punishment.

> For a punishment to be just it should consist of only such gradations of intensity as suffice to deter men from committing crimes.

– Cesare Beccaria, _On Crimes and Punishments_ #quote 

## Enlightenment Art and Religion
In opposition to the extravagance and glorification of Baroque art, Enlightenment art favored simple scenes and regular people. The neoclassical style used simple, dull styles and tones with select classical themes.

Classical composers created a new type of music: symphony music, that was intended to be melodic and sophisticated. Vienna was the hotspot of this movement.

German Pietism emphasized personal transformation thorugh spiritual rebirth and renewal, individual devotion, and piety laid in a personal connection, introspection, and liturgical [[Protestant Reformation#Lutheranism]]. It was founded by Philip Spencer #person in the 17th century.

Novels became popular in everyday life. The importance of being educated, having good morals, and being polite was emphasized. Two examples of novels that were widely read were Samuel Richardson #person’s _Pamela_ #book and Jane Austen #person’s *Pride and Prejudice* #book.

## Romanticism
Several artists and authors were also not as excited about the cold precision and elegance of Enlightenment Art and [[Reason]]. A new movement gained popularity at the end of the 18th century, which celebrated individual feeling, emotion, and passion: romanticism.

Novelists like Goethe in Germany emphasized strong artistic emotions, depicting characters dealing with love, frustration, and connecting with nature. Art and paintings began to depict scenes of nature and romance. In music, romantic composers like Beethoven disrupted the elegant, precise symphonies of classical composers with rough, violent, musical movements.

Religiously, Methodism emerged in Christianity from the early romantic thought and theology of John Wesley #person. Methodism was essentially a religious revival driven by a close, personal, and highly emotional connection with god, thus linking it with early Romanticism.

## [[Reason]] Questioned
Not all 18th century contemporaries were convinced of the primacy of Enlightenment rationality and reason. Rousseau #person, for example, is often considered an outlier and “idiot” of the Enlightenment as he openly rejected Enlightenment rationalitya s the sole determining force in society, arguing instead that emotion played a more pivotal role.

Furthermore, Scottish Enlightenment thinker David Hume #person asserted that passion, rather than [[Reason]], governs human behavior. He was also a sentimentalist who held that ethics are based on emotion or sentiment rather than abstract moral principle, famously proclaiming that:

> [[Reason]] is, and ought only to be, the slave of the passions.
