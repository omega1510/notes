This emphasis of being well-rounded in several subjects is referred to as [[Italian Renaissance]] humanism: the study of the humanities (art, philosophy, history, etc.) Later, this would develop into humanism, which emphasized the value and agency of human beings. In other words, humans, and not God, were the center of life. Instead of revelation, they claimed to use [[Reason]]. ^720c65

## Humanist Literature
[[Italian Renaissance]] humanism not only changed education, but its impact was also seen in literature, are, and politics. Traditionally, all stories, songs, and poems were based on God or some sort of invincible hero tied to God.

Petrarch dismissed the idea of perfect human heroes or Christian morality, Instead focussing on the moral issues of the individual. He wrote of love, hate, admiration, and sadness, painting a picture of what he thought was more realistic.

Giovanni Boccaccio also stuck to the individual, non-heroic theme in his work ***The Decameron*** – a compilation of stories about several people. In his stories, Boccaccio describes the moral dilemmas people have to deal with as prostitutes, criminals, and regular people rather than being perfect or heroic.

## Christian and Civic Humanism
In addition to a focus on secular life, the Renaissance’s emphasis on the individual impacted religious life. Mostly in Northern Europe, thinkers began reading [[Classics|classical]] Christian texts, such as the Bible and St. Augustine.

During the Middle Ages, Christianity had become highly dependent on the Pope, rituals, traditions, and relics. Upon reading [[Classics|classical]], early Christian books, Christian humanists reinterpreted the understanding of these texts to reject the pope and traditions. Instead of respecting and obeying the Church, the Pope, and its traditions, these thinkers privatized their spiritual life and relationship with God. They followed religion according to their own thoughts and desires, a practice encouraged by the changing economic and political demands of the time.

These became marks of the Northern Renaissance – an emphasis on regular human life and private religion.

The questioning of the corrupt Church and a new emphasis on secular life spawned a new movement: civic humanism. Still drawing from the [[Classics]], intellectuals advocated that not only should people seek a well-rounded education, but they should be involved in the community.

Rather than be an educated hermit and write about what you think is wrong, intellectuals like Leonardo Bruni advocated being proactive. This meant voting, participating in politics, and discussing issues and reforms.

Because of humanism, Bruni and others emphasized focusing on secular life and politics, as well as being involved as a citizen in shaping their own world.

### Church Reform
Two Christian humanists and their works embodied the movement: Erasmus #person in the Praise of Folly #book and Thomas Moore #person in Utopia #book. Both of these men agreed that Christianity should serve as a guiding moral philosophy, not a strict set of rules. Both men wrote heavily on the topic of corruption in the Church, and highly criticized the “sale” of salvation, Church positions, and nepotism in the Church office.

They claimed that the Church had drifted from the true intentions and the beliefs of Christianity. However, their own movements were even more corrupt and included practices that went against the practices and traditions of early Christians. For example, Jesus taught that the poor are blessed, but these new [[Capitalism]] reform Christians believed that the rich were blessed instead since riches were signs of God’s pleasures, poverty his disdain.

Following the [[Protestant Reformation]], the Catholic Church underwent a [[Catholic Counter-Reformation]], drawing from the ideals of Christian Humanists.

## Niccolo Machiavelli #person
With a focus on the individual and a break from the importance of traditional theology, thinkers began to question how governments were operated. One of the first Renaissance thinkers to question the role of the government was Niccolò Machiavelli, who came from war-torn parts of Italy.

In the Middle Ages, politics were ruled by the idea that a king, prince, or noble ought to rule as a just and moral Christian. Machiavelli argued that this was an ineffective approach; instead, a ruler should use whatever means necessary to obtain and run a kingdom. In his book, ***The Prince*** #book, Machiavelli outlined that in politics, anything goes, as long as it works.

> The lion cannot protect himself from traps, and the fox cannot defend himself from wolves. One must therefore be a fox to recognize traps, and a lion to frighten wolves.

> If an injury has to be done to a man it should be so severe that his vengeance need not be feared.

> I'm not interested in preserving the status quo; I want to overthrow it.

– Niccolò Machiavelli, *The Prince* #quote

## Secularism
By the 16th century, the public had taken Machiavelli’s message to heart. The early [[Capitalism|capitalist]] elites began to question the legitimacy of the Church and its power over governments, wanting to weaken the church and grab power for themselves instead by stealing their authority, lands, and power.

One intellectual in particular that agreed was Jean Bodin #person. He believed the corrupt Church, the Pope in particular, should not be involved in European politics. Instead, he advocated strong, centralized governments that controlled their own taxes and politics with no Church involvement. he had no issues with the rich and [[Capitalism|capitalist]] elite having involvement.

While the Church was largely uninvolved with crimes or punishments in secular Europe, older Christian punishments were still used by authorities. Punishment remained a public spectacle, with stocks, branding, whipping, and torture. Secular authorities also maintained religious laws in former Catholic states. Many, like [[Centralization of Power#Philip II person|Philip II]], continued to use the Inquisition to convert or execute heretics. ^f6d58b
