# Martin Luther #person
---

Like [[Humanism#Church Reform|Erasmus and Moore]], a monk named Martin Luther opposed the church’s authority. Luther rejected most of the rituals, traditions, deeds, and powers of the Church, and wrote fiercely against them.

On October 31, 1517, he nailed his book, 95 Theses #book, to the wall of the Wittenberg Castle Church. In it, he listed all the problems he had with the Pope and Roman Catholic Church. This sparked the beginnings of the [[Protestant Reformation]]

> The pope neither desires nor is able to remit any penalties except those imposed by his own authority or that of the canons.
