# Catholic Counter-Reformation
---

The [[Protestant Reformation]] devastated the power of the Catholic Church and its influence. Nobles took Church land and avoided Church taxes. Half of all Catholics became protestant, mostly in German areas.

Church leaders decided to contemplate accepting Protestant ideas in an attempt to regain power.

## Council of Trent
At the Council of Trent (1545 – 1563), Catholic leaders discussed the issues brought forth by the Protestants and discussed changes. However, they decided to reject Protestant claims and maintain their former system. Catholics doubled down on their opposition to Protestants, training priests and emphasizing Christian spiritual roots.

## Church Reforms
Catholics sought to reinvigorate the people that remained faithful to Catholicism. Drawing ideas from [[Humanism#Christian and Civic Humanism|Christian Humanists]], the Church encouraged priests, monks, and bishops to look to older Christian writings for inspiration. This sparked a renewed sense of belonging to the Church and a close, personal relationship with God.

However, scripture was not the only authority. Rules, regulations, and changes were still the Church’s right to make. The Church highly promoted any writing that spoke highly of them and their values. Ignatius of Loyola’s #person book *Spiritual Exercises* was a prime example of this. In it, he laid out a step-by-step plan about how to be close to god by maintaining Catholic values. Furthermore, a nun named St. Teresa of Avila #person wrote about dedicating your body and soul to God by maintaining the Church’s traditions. ^3eca78

Finally, the Church founded the Society of Jesus (Jesuits), dedicated to education, recovering Protestants, and converting new members.

## Opposition to Protestants
The Counter-Reformation had no hopes of agreeing with Protestants. Catholic leaders were encouraged to make laws forbidding Protestants. They made an *Index of Prohibited Books*, banning anything that seemed heretic.

The Church also promoted the Inquisition, which traveled around Europe seeking out heretics like Jews, scientists, and Protestants. The inquisition brutally killed and murdered thousands of people in Spain, Italy, France, the Holy Roman Empire, and the Netherlands. However, once the Pope found out about this, he strongly condemned this movement.
