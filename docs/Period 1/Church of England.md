## Henry VIII of England #person
King Henry VIII is a prime example of someone who [[State Control of Religion|controlled their country]], along with its morals and religion. In 1532, Henry joined the [[Protestant Reformation]] movement, starting his own branch: the Church of England. He did this because he wanted complete control over religion and not have to follow the rules of the Pope. ^def839

The Church of England operated similarly to the Catholic Church, but with the King as the head, instead of the Pope. Henry could make religious rules that benefited him. Most notably, he changed the rules surrounding annulment, allowing him to divorce his first wife. ^744481

## Elizabeth I #person 
Elizabeth I was King Henry’s daughter. She is also an example of a monarch that exercised authoritative control over religion and state.

When Queen Mary I of England #person, Henry’s successor, took the crown, she returned England to Catholicism. Furthermore, she hunted and executed any Anglicans in the country. However, when Elizabeth came to power, she imprisoned Mary and re-established the Church of England.

Queen Elizabeth I’s two main acts as monarch were:
- **Act of Supremacy:** This established English monarchs as the head of the Anglican Church.
- **Act of Uniformity**: This created a *Book of Common Prayer* and required all people in England to attend church on Sunday.
