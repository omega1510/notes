# Mercantilism
---

A drastic rise in money in the 16th century led to more investment opportunities. This expanded joint-stock investment, as more people were able to invest in exploration and start new companies. 

The Dutch and English particularly developed a whole new set of economic tactics with which to compete with other Europeans and protect their interests: Mercantilism.

The 18th century was dominated by European trade and commerce through the Mercantile System. Guilds controlled wages, prices, and professions. Governments used tariffs to control imports and the economy, a practice called protectionism.

Europeans continued to exploit and control **single-export based colonies**, like Jamaica, Haiti, Brazil, Mexico, etc. These colonies benefited economically from the exportation of primarily one set of natural resources. They would provide cheap goods and materials to enrich their mother country.

Furthermore, nations used privateers (legal pirates) to disrupt and steal the trade of other countries.

The [[Age of Exploration#Treatment of Natives and Africans|African Slave Trade]] and plantation systems peaked in the 1700s, as tobacco and cotton demand skyrocketed. The [[Age of Exploration#Columbian Exchange|Columbian Exchange]] grew as Europeans began manufacturing textiles to sell outside of Europe.

Additionally, money and income resulted in more taxes for governments to fund exploration, thus enabling more colonization and charger companies to form (British East India Company and Dutch east India Company). Following the [[Seven Years' War]], the British and the Dutch had eliminated the Spanish, Portuguese, and French competition in Asia. This allowed charter companies to settle and spread, dominating the governments and economies of India and Indonesia. ^cd2cf5
