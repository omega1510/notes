## Origin of the Classics
Through the Abbasid Caliphate, crusades, and the Mongols, [[Italian Renaissance]] thinkers came across new classical and scientific texts. Coming in through the Italian city-states, Europe in the 14th century would start rediscovering and utilizing Islamic and Greek knowledge.

Italy, specifically Florence and Venice, became the center for the [[Italian Renaissance]] as Italy was the center of commerce and papacy at the time. Merchants and crusaders returned to the Italian city-states following their journeys, bringing with them classic texts.

## What the Classics Taught
Writers like Francesco Petrarch #person were profoundly influenced by these classical texts and their emphasis on regular life, not Christianity. Since Greek and Roman writers predated Christianity, their lives were not determined by religion. Classical knowledge was more focused on the life of the individual and developing a well-rounded set of knowledge and skills â€“ a hallmark of Muslim scholars. ^6b7723
