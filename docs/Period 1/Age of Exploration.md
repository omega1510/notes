# Age of Exploration

## Spain and Portugal
While searching for a route to join the lucrative Indian Ocean Trade Network, Europeans stumbled on the Americas in the late 1400s. While the Spanish and Portuguese were the first to initiate large-scale exploration, all Europeans were inspired to explore by the 3 Gs: **God, Gold, and Glory**.

The Portuguese focused more on setting up trade posts in Africa and South/East Asia, while the Spanish focused more on conquering the Americas, Caribbean, and Pacific by forming colonies.

Spain, with its vast silver mining, would become the most powerful European state up until the [[Thirty Years’ War]].

### Treaty of Tordesillas
> Treaty of Tordesillas, (June 7, 1494), agreement between Spain and Portugal aimed at settling conflicts over lands newly discovered or explored by Christopher Columbus and other late 15th-century voyagers.

## New Technologies
New technologies allowed people to travel more accurately, safely, quickly, and cheaply. They included:
- Lateen sails
- Stern-post rudder
- Knowledge of wind patterns
- Compass
- Astrolabe
- Portolan maps
- Royal patronage and joint-stock investment
- Guns and cannons

## Columbian Exchange
The Columbian Exchange was the system of trade between the New World and the Old World. Cattle, horses, pigs, smallpox, measles, rice, and wheat were sent to the New World. Tomatoes, potatoes, corn, tobacco, turkey, and syphilis came to the Old World.

In the Old World, there was a massive population increase due to calorie-dense foods imported from the Americas. They gained vast amounts of wealth due to increased trade with foreign nations. Atlantic states now had the most economic power, not the Italian city-states (who failed to quickly [[Centralization of Power|centralize]]).

Because of spreading disease, the New World experienced a massive population loss. Natives of the Americas were enslaved and oppressed in plantations and mines. Additionally, they were forced to convert to Christianity.

## England, France, and the Netherlands
England, France, and the Netherlands entered the exploration scene late, but still tried to form new colonies. All three established colonies in North America and the Caribbean. The Dutch established a colony in Indonesia, and the French and British in India.

Spain, Portugal, England, France, and the Dutch dominated world trade for the next two centuries, fighting in Europe, and competing for colonies and resources throughout the world. In fact, the Dutch and English particularly developed a whole new set of economic tactics with which to compete with other Europeans: [[Mercantilism]].

## Treatment of Natives and Africans
One of the primary motivations for the Catholic explorers was missionary work: to convert, in some cases by force, Native Americans to Catholicism. While some missionaries were kind, many were quite violent.

Natives working for colonial rulers were often required to practice Christianity, and were forced to hide their beliefs through syncretism. Additionally, most Spanish and Portuguese rulers viewed the Natives as barbaric and inferior, and required civilizing and enlightenment from Christianity.

> The natives are an inoffensive people, and so desirous to possess any thing they saw with us, that they kept swimming off to the ships with whatever they could find, and readily bartered for any article we saw fit to give them in return, even such as broken platters and fragments of glass. I saw in this manner sixteen balls of cotton thread which weighed above twenty-five pounds, given for three Portuguese ceutis. It \[the cotton] grows in this island, but from my short stay here I could not satisfy myself fully concerning it; the gold, also, which they wear in their noses, is found here, but not to lose time.

Natives were also forced to work on mines and plantations (haciendas), called the Encomienda System. Some Europeans, however, opposed Native treatment and the Encomienda System, such as Bartolome de Las Casas #person, arguing such treatment is unchristian.

Africans were also harmed in the Age of Exploration. In need of cheap and free labor, the Atlantic Slave Trade began, in which Europeans bought or captured West Africans for work. African slaves were forced to endure the grueling Middle Passage trip from Africa as part of the Triangular Trade System.

Under this system, goods from the New World came to Europe and were either sold or used for manufacturing. The profits and goods were then sold to West Africa and Asia, allowing for more slaves to be purchased for the haciendas.

> Pagans, therefore must be treated most gently with all charity. Nor should any trace of Evil be visible in our actions and then you will be innocent and genuine, perfect children of God among a deceitful and understood brood. Let your moderation be known to all men and in everything you do make yourself an example to them of working for good....
> 
> Christ did not give the church power over the pagans to annoy, persecute, afflict, and arouse them to riot and sedition, and to hatred of the Christian religion, but only the power of gentleness, service, kindness, and the words of the gospel to encourage them to put on the gentle yoke of Christ.
