## Impact of [[Humanism]] on Art
Through art, we can learn about the issues and ideas that dominated and defined the [[Italian Renaissance]]. Two main features define renaissance art and separate it from medieval art:
- An emphasis on the individual and not God
- Use of [[Classics|classical]] figures, architecture, and style

Visual art during the renaissance symbolized humanism, and that people are worth being portrayed. Furthermore, art began including [[Classics|classical]] figures (Aristotle, Plato, etc.) and a Greco-Roman style of architecture (marble pillars and buildings). ^048e52

## Art During the Renaissance
More effort was put into art because of the new, human focus. A new technique called geometric perspective was used to make paintings accurate. Paintings portrayed real, 3D characters, with the shading, shadows, and expressions that normal human bodies showcase.

Rafaelâ€™s *School of Athens* is a great example of this:

Themes of regular human life were very prominent in the Northern Renaissance, although not exclusive to that region. Examples include the *Mona Lisa* and *Cathedral in France*.

## Patrons of Art
With the rise of Renaissance art, people hired artists to paint, sculpt, and build artwork for them. Princes, merchants, and other patrons hired artists to paint them in the new, realistic style.

The Roman Catholic Church also hired artists for statues and buildings, like the *Sistine Chapel* or the *Cathedral in Florence.*
