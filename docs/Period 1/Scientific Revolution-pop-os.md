## [[Reason]] and Challenging the [[Classics]]
Renaissance thinkers, armed with [[Reason]] and [[Reason#Skepticism|Skepticism]], began questioning 3 main ideas that were previously thought to be true:
- Ptolemy’s idea of the universe.
- Galen’s work on anatomy.
- Aristotle’s idea of gravity.

### Copernicus #person
Copernicus questioned [[Classics]] in the 15th century, using math to prove that the Earth was not the center of the universe, and that we orbited the sun. This model challenged Ptolemy’s geocentric model, replacing it with a new, heliocentric model of the Solar System.

He plagiarized this math from Sheikh Nasir al-Din al-Tusi (d. 1274), who had previously written about these topics.

## Old Ideas Overturned

### Ptolemy’s Idea of the Universe
Copernicus’s heliocentric model went unnoticed by most people. But, by the late 16th century, a man named Galileo #person had invented the modern telescope, and after months of observation, he was able to confirm Copernicus’s theory.

### Aristotle’s Theory of Gravity
Another idea that Galileo had been able to disprove via experiment was Aristotle’s theory that heavy objects fall faster than light objects.

### Galen’s Theory of Anatomy
In anatomy, a scientist named Vesalius #person began dissecting cadavers and found that Galen’s theories of the four humors were completely wrong. Following that, William Harvey #person made the discovery that the body functions in humans as an integrated system.

All of these new ideas caused an uproar in science – if these [[Classics]] were wrong for so many years, how do we know what’s right?

## The Scientific Method
The new focus for obtaining knowledge became known as the scientific method: something is only true if it can be tested, observed, and repeated. It was a combination of skepticism and proof – you should doubt or not believe anything that could not be proven by math or testing.

This change in thought was known as the Scientific Revolution, a new process of proving what is true, and using new inventions to help accomplish it.

Thinkers such as Isaac Newton #person took this idea even further, and established a set of laws for the universe based on testing/math, known as Newtonian Physics. Not only did Newton define universal laws, but he designed and developed calculus, which has allowed mathematicians to solve complex problems.

## Types of Reason

In addition to the ideas of Newton, Bacon, and Descartes, monarchs and governments began to publicly fund scientists to figure out the universe. They formed Royal Societies to question, develop, and test new ideas.
