## Anarchism
There were some people who were not moved by nationalist sentiments, instead arguing against nations and governments. Founded by Mikhail Bakunin #person, anarchism was the belief that all forms of government are inherently oppressive and should therefore be abolished.

Coming from Tsarist Russia, Bakunin saw the devastation and poor treatment faced by Eastern Europeans in the face of imperial Russia, Austria, and Prussia. He also grew frustrated with governmentsâ€™ [[Socialism|socialist]] reforms, instead trying to keep workers unprotected. To Bakunin, governments were corrupt instruments of powerful people, and he believed people should live without them in small, industrial communities. These communities were largely self-governing, similarly to how Europe operated in the Middle Ages.

To protect and spread their ideas, Anarchists usually turned violent. They opposed governments by bombing buildings and killing officials.
