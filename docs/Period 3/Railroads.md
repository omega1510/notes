# Railroads and the [[Industrial Revolution]]

## Before Railroads
There was no standardized time before the railroad. Its advent brought a need for new organization and  time management. The Railway Clearing House created Greenwich Mean Time, standardizing time across England.

Speaking of time, the distance you had travelled was measured by fatigue before the railroad. Muscle powered transport (horses, oxen) gave you a clear understanding of how far you had gone. If your horse was tired, you had likely travelled a large distance. The railroad broke this understanding of distance = fatigue by greatly speeding up transport.

During the stagecoach era, people were forced to make conversation with the person they were sitting with because of the long journey. With the railroad’s quick journey, people resorted to reading books and newspapers, even while sitting right next to someone. Start of [[Introverted Personality]]?

## Railroads in the [[Industrial Revolution]]
Railroads were new in the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Advances in steel production and the steam engine revolutionized transportation with the invention and cheap spread of the railroad.

Although railroads were in high demand, they required immense amounts of capital to lay and maintain them. This led to the need for a stable and complex banking system. In England, the Bank of England filled this role, funding nearly a thousand miles of railroad networks in the country. Furthermore, England’s large iron and coal deposits let them use the steam engine in trains without importing materials.

Railroads made transportation costs lower, boosted economic efficiency, and reduced travel time for cargo and passengers. They were where people came face to face with modern technology at a time where most travelers were middle and upper class. The railroad changed the lives of these upperclassmen by speeding up transport, creating new towns and suburbs, and opening up vacation spots.

## Effects of the Railroad
The railroad cemented the new societal classes that had been created by the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The railways allowed the upper and middle classes to travel more easily efficiently and live in a more stable and secure environment. These classes greatly benefited from the railroads, which sped up transport, created new towns and suburbs, and opened up new vacation spots. However, the working class responsible for building trains and maintaining the rail network faced dangerous working conditions and no protection if they were injured. ^c245d2

Additionally, people liked the thrill of the fast blur outside their train window. Other people were scared about the new, modern technology, but eventually grew fond of the benefits of rail travel.

> It is really flying, and it is impossible to divest yourself of the notion of instant death to all upon the least accident happening.

> Tremendous foreboding such as we always feel when there comes an enormous, an unheard-of event whose consequences are imponderable and incalculable.

> New modes of behavior and perception enabled the traveler to lose the fear that he formerly felt towards the new conveyance.

> The sinister aspect of the machinery that first was so evident and frightening gradually disappeared, and with this disappearance, fear waned and was replaced by a feeling of security based on familiarity.

The [[Industrial Revolution]] and the railroad associated change with progress. Children will have a better life than their parents (social mobility).

Unlike earlier inventions like the printing press, the railroad effected a large number of people, not just the wealthy and educated. It created jobs for the working class and expanded the upper and middle classes horizons.
