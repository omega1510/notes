# Count Cavour
---

Count Cavour of Cavour, like his contemporary [[Napoleon III]], was a [[New Conservatism|new conservative]]. He used a very pragmatic political approach to appease and work with powerful groups, whether he agreed with them or not. His intent was to keep the monarch as the head of Piedmont, but he also had to maintain order in the [[Nationalism]] and [[Liberalism]] movements, which desired natural rights and constitutionalism.

To placate liberals in Piedmont, he moved to confiscate Italian territory from Austria and unify the Italian states as one, powerful kingdom. To maintain the monarchy, he admitted states to the union under the agreement that they would adhere to a constitutional monarchy.

To maintain the existence of the Catholic Church, he negotiated with his political enemy—the radical liberal Garibaldi #person—in order to ensure Garibaldi’s forces did not dismantle it as he originally intended.
