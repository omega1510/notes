# New Conservatism
---

New leaders attempted to unify, develop, and maintain states through political placation. In the 19th century, these conservative leaders favored monarchy, authority, and state religion, hence the “conservative” moniker. However, these leaders, after several revolutions, decided to embrace the necessary change to placate progressive groups like [[Nationalism|nationalists]], [[Socialism|socialists]], and [[Liberalism|liberals]].

Known as “New Conservatives”, these people believed in traditional monarchy and authority but issued reforms to maintain order and prevent revolts.

Key examples include [[Napoleon III]] of France and [[Count Cavour]] of Cavour, as well as [[Otto von Bismark]].
