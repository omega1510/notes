## Formation of Political Parties
Set in motion by the [[Liberalism|liberals]] in the [[Chartism]] movement, political parties with uniform agendas began to form. These parties included larger amounts of working class citizens that advocated for intervention by the government and [[Socialism]].

It was clear complete, free market [[Capitalism]] was the only economic system capable of achieving positive social change for the poor and working class because of the price gouging practices and corruption of crony capitalism (big businesses and politicians). Because this was against their interests, crony capitalists and monopolies legally and violently prevented unionization.

However, in an effort to stop corrupt policies, new political parties formed in support of the expansion of the government in the economy to protect worker rights. Many liberals who supported free trade began to branch off in the late 19th century. These leaders formed massive political parties, like the German Social Democratic Party and the British Labour Party, comprised of working class constituents. They had the mission to protect the rights, well-being, and safety of the industrial working class.

Fearing such movements and a possible [[Communism|communist]] revolution, many governments were forced to pass laws and changes in the face of large, coordinate political groups. In Germany, [[Otto von Bismark]] #person pushed through social legislation in the 1880s to require companies or the state to provide accident insurance and worker pensions. In England, the efforts of the Labour Party were responsible for state pensions in 1908 and unemployment insurance in 1911.

## Feminism
In the early 19th century, the desire of [[Liberalism|liberal]] [[Chartism|chartists]] and [[Socialism|socialists]] to bring equality and expanded suffrage also spurred the first-wave feminism movement ü§Æ. Feminists such as Flora Tristan #person looked to the unions and emerging political parties of the working class as a model. She admired the organization and solidarity of working class unions and parties in striving for expanded worker rights and social reforms. She also admired the ‚Äúunited we stand, divided we fall‚Äù attitude and encouraged its application in early feminist organizations.

Beginning in the 1830s, women began an organized call for expanded women‚Äôs rights‚Äîmost of which called for peaceful legislative reform. However, some radical groups, like the British Women‚Äôs Social and Political Union (headed by the Pankhurst Family #person) chose a more direct and belligerent approach by practicing civil disobedience, harassing politicians, and intentionally getting arrested to raise awareness.

### The Temperance Movement
New [[Liberalism|liberals]] also advocated for state intervention to combat alcohol. To the eyes of the middle class, working class men had a very bad reputation as being uneducated and poor, as well as highly dependent on alcohol. Today, we know they were using this to ‚Äúescape reality‚Äù and cope with their awful conditions, however it had many adverse effects.

Domestic violence in working class families tended to be high, and new liberals believed low working class wages were being squandered on alcohol. Starting in the 1890s, many Christian and female middle class liberals began to formulate political opposition to alcohol in a movement called the Temperance movement. They believed that the lower classes were too lazy or unintelligent to stop themselves from wasting wages on the overconsumption of alcohol, so they moved to ban the substance. These groups were influential in eliminating alcohol sales on Sundays, the formation of dry counties, and eventually the banning of alcohol in the 18th amendment.
