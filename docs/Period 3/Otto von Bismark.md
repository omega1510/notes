# Otto von Bismark
---

Bismark, like [[Count Cavour]], used a diplomatic approach known as realpolitik, a pragmatic approach to politics in which one ignores the differences in personal beliefs to discuss and negotiate directly with opponents in the hopes of benefiting both parties. As a loyal prime minister who served his king Wilhelm, Bismarck placated [[Nationalism|nationalists]], [[Liberalism|liberals]], and later [[Socialism|socialists]] to keep himself and the king in power.

As Germany was in the early phases of development, Bismark placated nationalists by driving Prussia to unite the German provinces, and also placated liberals by establishing a small representative assembly in the new government, known as the Reichstag. In doing so, Bismark ensured that he and the kaiser remained at the top of the state hierarchy, while satisfying liberals with a representative assembly and nationalists with the unification movement.

After Germany had formed, Bismarck quickly had to pass new laws and policies to placate a growing new political group: working-class socialists. Prior to the mid-19th century, governments had embraced free market [[Capitalism]] and free trade, opposing attempts by workers to unify and collectively bargain against employers. However, with a growing, unified political movement, as well as the codified ideals of Marxism following 1848, many leaders feared a violent worker revolution.

Fearing the large group of workers organized in the German Social Democratic Party may eventually
lead to such a revolt, Bismarck shocked the world by using monarchical authority to make Germany the
first nation to pass openly socialist policies to satisfy a disgruntled working class:
- In 1883, Bismarck pushed a bill through the Reichstag that required employers and employees contribute to health insurance (they later drew the funds from federal and state programs.)
- In 1884, he pushed a bill through that required employers to provide accident insurance.
- In 1889, he pushed a bill through that provided a state pension and worker disability insurance.
