# Industrial Revolution

## Before the Industrial Revolution
China and India had dominated manufacturing throughout the 17th century. Europeans had been producing textiles, but they remained inferior to Chinese and Indian manufacturing techniques. Only once Europe began [[Mechanization]], they surpassed China and Indian manufacturing.

## Great Britain During the Revolution
Energy production in England accelerated the Industrial Revolution, as [[Mechanization]] required greater and greater sources of power. Many initial factories were powered by water and windmills, limiting their reach to windy areas and fast-flowing rivers.

**James Watt’s steam engine** (1775) changed that by allowing coal to power machinery. Coal was very abundant in Great Britain, which allowed them to create larger, iron machinery and manufactured products, such as the [[Railroads]]. 

## Government Support of Invention

![[Early Industrial Society#Pro Capitalism Laws]]

The available resources and supportive government of Great Britain allowed it to lead the way in industrialization, and it vastly increased manufacturing. At the Crystal Palace exhibition in 1851, British inventions and manufacturing goods far outnumbered all other countries at the fair.

## Railroads
[[Railroads]] were immensely significant in forming public thought about the modernization of society.

## Industrial Revolution in Mainland Europe
Industrialization was far slower on the mainland because of governments less supportive of urban [[Gentry]]. Agriculture remained the focus of economies in these areas, partly due to revolutions that made the economies too unstable for modernization.

In Eastern Europe, serfdom was still the dominant economic force, remaining even in Russia until tsar Alexander II emancipated the serfs in 1861 in an attempt to catch up to the West socially, and, unintentionally, to provide a source of industrial labor.

Some areas of Europe, like France, lacked the high quality iron and coal that had accelerated growth in England, Belgium, and Germany. These areas also usually lacked the advanced and consistent banking system that allowed for the expansion of [[Railroads]].

## Germany and France’s Alliance
Germany, paired with a ready source of coal and iron, launched itself into the Industrial Revolution head first. The **Zollverein**, a free trade union among German states, allowed the free trade of iron and capital across the union. In 1860, it formed the **Anglo-French Free-Trade Agreement** to boost it's and Frances trade and economy. However, France never expanded its [[Railroads]] like England and Germany, instead opting for a network of canals. ^018335
