# Communism
---

While many [[Liberalism|Liberals]] supported [[Capitalism]], the condition and plight of the working class would not go unnoticed. Two of the most influential opponents to Capitalism were Karl Marx #person  and Friedrich Engels #person - the developers of mainstream communism.

Marx and Engels believed in the historical view of human civilization as one of the struggles for the means of production and uneven distribution of wealth. Essentially, there was always a richer class that controlled the industry, and a lower class that worked to maintain it. However, the lower class always received a much smaller share of the returns, resulting in animosity and conflict.

## The Rise of Marxism
To Marx and Engels, private property was the root of all conflict, and to fix society, all property should be communal. [^1] They published their beliefs in a book, titled *The Communist Manifesto* #book.

[^1]: Originally, Marxists opposed marriage because the woman became the man’s property. This caused immediate and harsh turmoil all across Russia, so they were forced to abandon the idea.

> Let the ruling classes tremble at a Communistic revolution. The proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world to win.

> Working men of all countries, unite!

### Historical Struggles
- Masters and Slaves
- Patricians (Aristocrats) and Plebeians (Common People)
- Nobles and Peasants
- Bourgeoisie (Upper Class) and Proletariat (Marxists)

### The Marxism Plan:
1. **Revolution:** The proletariat rises up and takes the means of production and private property from the bourgeoisie.
2. **Socialism:** The government temporarily holds all production and property. They then equally distribute and manage it equally.
3. **Communism**: The government surrenders all production and property to the people and erases all national borders.
