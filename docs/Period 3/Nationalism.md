## Nationalism
While nationalism played a key role in [[National Movements|unifying Italy and Germany]], it would have other, violent consequences. 

One impact it had on Europe was that it created another deep divide, similar to Catholics and [[Protestant Reformation|Protestants]]. Nations were now concerned with expanding their borders, empires, militaries, and economies competitively. Passionate writers like Johann Fichte #person wrote passionately about nationalism, as many nations began to develop national flags, anthems, songs, animals, etc. These attitudes heightened conflict as nation-states competed for territory.

For example, the Franco-Prussian war and later imperial colonization in Africa were propelled by national competition.

## Pan-Slavism
While [[National Movements#Dual Monarchy Austria-Hungary|nationalist tensions in Austria]] had resulted in an autonomous Hungary and Croatia-Slovenia, the Slavs under Ottoman control were not so fortunate. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, violent protests, rebellions, and terrorist acts began to increase in the Balkans as Slavs fought for their independence.

This became known as Pan-Slavism. The powers of Europe were split on whether to support it against the Ottoman Empire or oppose it as it grew larger and more violent. It would result in violence as Serbia and Bulgaria were established. The Balkans won freedom from the Ottomans, but large numbers of Serbs and Bulgars remained under Ottoman control until the final thrust of Slavic nationalism chased the Ottoman Empire almost completely from Europe after the First Balkan War.

## Anti-Semitism
Nationalism also heightened anti-Semitism. Nations began forming on the basis of common ethnicity and culture - something the Jews of Europe didnâ€™t share. Jews were still present in large numbers throughout the 19th century, and they began to be increasingly seen as a menacing group.

As nationalism surged, politics also became anti-Semitic. For example, Karl Luegar #person founded the Austrian Christian social party. He is credited with modernizing Vienna, but his party advocated policies against non-Germans in Austria-Hungary and voted to restrict Jewish emigration from Russia to Romania.

One of the most infamous examples of anti-Semitism was the Dreyfus affair, where an innocent Jewish officer in the French army was accused of high treason. He spent years in a South American prison, until it was found that the French army had fabricated evidence against him.

## Zionism
During a period of widespread anti-Semitism, a new movement grew as many Jews called for their own Jewish state. An Austro-Hungarian Jew named Theodore Herzl #person developed the idea to organize and establish a Jewish homeland in Palestine. He urged wealthy Jewish families to lobby the British government to steal land from Palestine. After extensive financial support during World War I, European Jews would reach an accord with England during the Balfour Declaration of 1917, which promised British support of a Jewish state in Palestine.

While Jewish theft began after World War I, the state of Israel would not be established until 1948. The Jews, with the help of France, chased Palestinians out of their homes with grenades, not allowing them back. In this way, they established a new, Jewish state.
