## Creation of New Classes
The [[Industrial Revolution]] caused the formation of two new classes: the middle and working class.

### Middle Class
The middle class enjoyed a much improved lifestyle as factory owners, bankers, doctors, teachers, and other jobs. They are different from the middle class today; the middle class in the early industrial society was much, much richer than they are now. They, combined with the upper class, greatly benefited from the creation of [[Railroads]], although the working class fared worse.

### Working Class
The working class during this period were mostly former peasants forced into poor, run-down housing. They worked 10-14 hours a day, 6 days a week, with poor pay. Child labor was prevalent in factories, with little legal action taken against it.

Working conditions were very dangerous, with little protection if a worker was injured or sick. Any attempts to unionize were met with resistance from the middle class and the government, both of which wanted a cheap and free economy.

## [[Socialism]]
Socialism was formed to protect the exploited working class amid the clear divide between them and the middle class.
