# Imperialism
---

Imperialism is the domination of other countries by conquest or control, which began in the 1870s and 1880s. Earlier conquests had been limited to the Americas, where Native populations were decimated by disease and superior European technology. In Asia, however, empires were essentially unchanged as Europeans simply controlled trade or conquered small port cities.

However, after the 1870s, Europeans would also conquer and exploit the old land empires of Asia and penetrate the jungles of Africa. At this phase, Europe would more or less control almost the entire world due to its economic and technological advantages.

## New Technology
Thanks to the [[Second Industrial Revolution]], many new technologies and chemicals were available to aid conquest:
- Machine and breech-loading rifles made firepower far greater and more efficient, allowing for easy conquest of Asia and Africa.
- Steamboats allowed Europeans to travel upriver and into the interior of African jungles, where horses would often perish.
- Telegraphs and telephones allowed for better communication and coordination.
- Naval improvements to cannons and steel ships gave a clearer naval advantage.
- Quinine protected against tropical diseases, such as malaria.
- Discovery of bacteria let to greater soap use and boiled water.

## The Age of Imperialism
Prior to the 19th century, the extensive land empires of the Ottoman Empire in North Africa and the Middle East, the Safavid Dynasty in Persia, the Mughal Empire in India, and the Qing Dynasty in China operated relatively independently of Europeans, save for select port cities or trade taxes. While European companies, navies, pirates, and privateers controlled most of maritime trade, these empires set their own domestic policies.

However, starting in the mid 1800s, the British and French began to take vast areas of Ottoman land in North Africa and The Levant. The British constructed the Suez Canal in Egypt, allowing them direct access to India. In China, Britain and France would impose the sale of the drug opium, as well as annex several ports following the Opium Wars #war. Additionally, nearly every major European power would economically control a stretch of China by 1898, beginning a period referred to as the “Spheres of Influence”. Lastly, nearly all of Africa was under control of Europe by the 1890s during a phase known as the Scramble for Africa.

## Motives
### New Markets
One new motivation for Imperialism was the search for new markets. The [[Second Industrial Revolution]] made manufacturing so effective and cheap that Europe was now producing far more and far cheaper goods than the rest of the world. Their production had outstripped the ability for Europeans and the US to buy their goods; they had more goods than they could sell to each other.

As a result, Europeans and Americans sought to use their militaristic and economic advantages to force their trade and products on old Empires:
- The Opium Wars
- The British East India Company
- The British Raj (1858)
- Spheres of Influence
- Forced opening of Japan to world trade

In Africa, the goal was still raw materials: diamonds, gold, salt, copper, etc.

### Competition
The second motivation was national competition: the desire to prove the superiority of nation states and secure cheap, raw materials for their economies. Two major conflicts or confrontations that arose because of this race for conquest was the Scramble for Africa and the Moroccan Crises in 1905 and again in 1911.

While the Scramble for Africa was settled by [[Otto von Bismark]] in the Berlin Conference in 1885, it showed the competitive, [[Nationalism|nationalist]] nature of imperialism.

Tensions also almost resulted in all-out war between France and Germany on two occasions when German naval craft intentionally breached French waters in Morocco over dispute about imperial control and borders in the region.
