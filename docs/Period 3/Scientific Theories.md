## Positivism
By the 19th century, advances in science, technology, and industry had scientists and philosophers believing they were progressively approaching a complete understanding of the universe. To Auguste Comte #person and others, westerners were on the verge of figuring out all the universal laws that governed how the world and human society worked. This outlook was known as positivism.

Positivism, they believed, progressed in three phases:
1. **Theological Stage:** the world is understood through more complex ideas and thoughts, usually guided by a codified, universal set of beliefs and hierarchy.
2. **Metaphysical Stage:** people are guided by rational and scientific thought, proof, and understanding of the physical sciences.
3. **Positive Stage:** The central idea of society is individual rights through the development and understanding of science.

This idea was upheld until the scientific discoveries of the early 20th century, as well as the use of industrial technology for mass destruction and death in World War I.

## Darwinism
A new scientific system would challenge [[Enlightenment#Cultural Development|cultural relativism]] and European superiority and domination, called Darwinism. In his magnum opus *The Origin of Species* #book in 1859, Charles Darwin #person provided a biological explanation for the evolution of species that operated on universal laws of survival. According to Darwin, variations in species make some more fit to survive; this concept is known as natural selection. Those best genetically equipped to survive will thrive, and the rest will perish as the dominant species’ population grows.

> One general law, leading to the advancement of all organic beings, namely, multiply, vary, let the strongest live and the weakest die.

– Charles Darwin, *On The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle For Life* #quote

### Social Darwinism
His theory became widely adopted as a natural process, but Europeans quickly applied it abstractly to human beings. Now, to [[Enlightenment]] thinkers, they were not only culturally superior, but genetically superior. Known as Social Darwinism, many Europeans believed that the domination of their economies and culture was inevitable, justified, and a simple, universal law.

They began to see poor and primitive people as inferior and incapable of improvement, thus viewing the exploitation of the working class and weaker countries as a natural scientific process. Furthermore, it was the “burden of the White Man” to forcibly spread their economic institutions across the world to improve the civilizations of inferior people. They saw themselves as the beacons of civilizations, bringing technology in order, and ending barbaric practices.

The British, for example, took it upon themselves to ban “sati”, the practice of widows throwing themselves on their deceased husband’s funeral pyre in 19th century India.

This view justified [[Imperialism]] and the exploitation of other countries.
