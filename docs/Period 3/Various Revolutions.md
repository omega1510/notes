# Various Revolutions

## July Revolution #war, France
In France, due to the [[Congress of Vienna]], the old monarch was restored and the Catholic Church was given back a portion of the land and power it had prior to the [[French Revolution]]. However, in July 1830, King Charles X #person made the mistake of passing the July Ordinances that officially excluded the commercial classes from elections. With the ideals of the [[French Revolution]] fresh in their minds, the French people overthrew Charles X during the July Revolution.

While it was still a monarchy, the revolution had won the rights of popular sovereignty in the government and gotten rid of noble rights once again. It also inspired revolutions in other areas, such as Belgium, Italy, and Poland. None would last, except for Belgium. In the Belgian Revolution #war against the Netherlands, French-speaking Catholics achieved independence and formed the Kingdom of Belgium.

## Greek War of Independence #war, Greece
In Southern Europe, the War of Greek Independence was waged by Greek revolutionaries against the Ottoman Empire between 1821 and 1830. While Greek forces were initially successful in driving out the Ottoman Turks, the Ottoman state of Egypt helped them reconquer Greece in exchange for land.

Following years of negotiation, Russia, Britain, and France decided to intervene in the conflict and each nation sent a navy to Greece. By 1828, the Egyptian army withdrew under pressure of a French expeditionary force. The Ottoman garrisons then surrendered, while the Greeks reclaimed the Ottoman-controlled parts of the country. After eight years of war, Greece was finally recognized as an independent, sovereign state under the London Protocol of February 1830.

## Revolutions of 1848 #war, France
While [[Absolutism]] continued into the mid-19th century, a growing call for Republican and Enlightenment ideals grew, as well as calls for unification and [[Nationalism]].

Starting in France, poor economic conditions and famine created a very unhappy situation for the French people in 1848, so they called for a constitution. The king, Louis-Philippe #person, refused, stating that he had already taken noble rights and allowed regular people to participate in government. This resulted in Paris being quickly overrun by middle and lower class Frenchmen, who overthrew the government. France now established an official republic with a constitution, [[Gentry]] parliament, and a President - both elected with complete male suffrage.

News of this new republic spread via newspaper, and nearly ever major city in all of Europe began their own revolution. Empowered by both liberal ideals and [[Nationalism]], revolutions popped up quickly in Italy, Germany, Austria, Hungary, etc. [[Congress of Vienna|Metternich]] fled in fear from Austria, as all governments were either removed or met the demands of the revolutionaries. Nobles were removed, constitutions drafted, and a new era of change began.

## Impacts of the Revolutions
- While some revolutions did fail, they also showcased the instability in Europe's feudal system.
- Nationalities that were split apart or forced under the rule of a large empire were not going to last.
- People no longer identified with local rulers or religions, but now with a common race, language, and culture.
- 1848 would be the last time Russia and others would work together to maintain their monarchies and the [[Congress of Vienna]].
